Thankfully its interesting…
Of Orcs and Men is an action RPG game about the struggle between Orcs and men…
Its humans vs green skins…
Here you play as 2 characters…
Arkail who is a warrior brute from the legendary Bloodjaws as well as his Goblin companion Styx who offers ranged and stealth gameplay who’s job is to help Arkail get to where he needs to go on his mission to kill the emperor and change the course of the war…
The story and characters are the best part of the game…
I laughed out loud numerous times thanks to the loudmouth Styx having no filters when talking to Arkail and other characters.. And the story is full of twists and turns that this 12 hour game is genuinely enjoyable and surprising…
You even get to make choices to change minor story outcomes
and the level design here is great...
This is a very linear game... but areas feel open and theyre crawling with enemies and equipment…
Where the game is held back though is its combat itself…
Here you can play as either Styx or Arkail... and you can switch back and forth instantaneously…
Styx, who was my favorite to play as can go into stealth mode and clear some or all of the enemies out before progressing to prevent as few combat situations as possible which is ideal..
Because the combat is just no fun...
Basically both characters are on autopilot…
You put attacks in their commands list from different fighting stances and let them do their thing...
you really don’t even have to touch the controller until late in the game if you don’t want to…
because of this put in commands combat system, you never truly feel in control…
You don’t feel like you’re using strategy to win...
just that youre desperately running around with styx throwing knives and healing Arkail so you don’t have to start again... neither of the 2 have strategy programmed into them… if you leave styx he automatically goes into close range when he has considerably less health than arkail… so hell die almost instantly…
Its almost like you really have no choice but to use him
In some instances youll get into fights after messing up a stealth kill or being seen and arkail is just standing there looking at you instead of running to help…
As you do complete battles youll level up so you can balance the characters in areas theyre weak or make them stronger in areas there already strong in.. So the juggling act isn’t as annoying…
And you can unlock new skills and upgrade them with a choice of a perk to suit your gameplay style…
but it’s a bad sign when playing your game is the worst part of your game...
its an alright time and worth experiencing..
Especially for the story, level design, and being introduced to these characters…

The game comes with one nice story (even though it looks like Dragon Age sometimes), but all the pretty story gets lost with the poor voicing, worst gameplay, pitty animations and not a little immersive world. You just go through the one-way all the time, finding enemies here and there, and sometimes you'll find a whole bunch of them, and, if you're not a hardcore, like me, you'll find some parts really annoying and impossible to past (i didn't even finish the **** game. Had to stop before start banging my head against the wall). It's shotty, if you've ever played any decent RPG you'll find this annoying in all aspects that matters. So, don't play it.

My favourite aspects of the game are the soundtrack and story, soundtrack is excellent really entertaining and paces well with gameplay and story, the story itself is decent but is let down often by pretty lacklustre cut scenes. Rpg elements are very basic leveling is ok but there is an obvious lack of depth on the equipment end of this, armour and weapons are few and far between with little chance to actually upgrade.

~~This game was fun for me this OCTOBER 2013. And I ignored the fact that it was an old game and was wanting to spend some MONEY I HAD ON MY account. And this was worth it for a affordable game..
--Graphics aren't Last of us,Halo,Or Bioshock but does that matter on NON-blockbuster games anyways? NO! With arcade or PSN or downloadable games Graphics and voice acting need only be swervicable for our fun. Story & gameplay and unique level up or loot etc.. I enjoyed this game and if one is 100% true to themselves when they start playing it, then dissapointmen t will be less because I knew this game was just a 2 day type game. anything more is a perk..

--No game deserves a ZERO! We should only be allowed so many ZERO's, or it should be monitored or controlled..I bet 90% of reviewers who attack games with a ZERO do it on a regular ****!
- I could see a 2 maybe. a ONE **** is brokem and can not be **** a ZERO is misused..
--I look forward to innovation with scoring...

I gave this a 10 to balance out the OBVIOUS Hate-Spam that took place..
-Metacritic has a good Rep but that wont last forever. Even though the Meta-Score is what we go-by and use as a quick tool etc,,But I used to really like user **** not when THERE'S 200+ Scores of -0- with no comments..",70,"Big orcs and tiny goblins make for unlikely and enjoyable heroes.

before I get into it, let me states some facts: 90% of gamers are men, male gamers are more prone to enjoy violent games, the manlier the characters, the more the male gamers will enjoy it.

THAT BEING SAID.

This game is about as polished at a pile of poop. Instead of immersing you into a fantasy world where you play an orc, you come away feeling like you played a green painted, redneck with about as much nod to his own orchood, as me. They curse in English, which jars you. And, it's not even cursing to accentuate sentences. It's cursing, in the way that white frat boys curse, just to punctuate sentences. So instead of you thinking, wow these orcs are real manly tough guys, you come away thinking I WONDER DO THEY TAN IN BEDS OR OUT IN THE SUN. The voice acting doesn't help that they sound like fresh out the bed dweebs, raspy, breathy, man-voice with boy grammatical structure.

It would have been much better if the developer took the time to come up with 100 orc ""words"" and punctuate all the orc conversations with them.

I give it an 8 our of 10, but rated it 10 here because although this game demonstrates that orcs and goblins can sometimes be the good guys, trolls will forever be trolls  obnoxious (low ratings before playing the game), cowardly (low ratings with no review) and a plague on our gaming community.",70,It is no Elder Scrolls but is perhaps worth a look for RPG fans who want to keep themselves busy over the coming months.

~~This game was fun for me this OCTOBER 2013. And I ignored the fact that it was an old game and was wanting to spend some MONEY I HAD ON MY account. And this was worth it for a affordable game..
--Graphics aren't Last of us,Halo,Or Bioshock but does that matter on NON-blockbuster games anyways? NO! With arcade or PSN or downloadable games Graphics and voice acting need only be swervicable for our fun. Story & gameplay and unique level up or loot etc.. I enjoyed this game and if one is 100% true to themselves when they start playing it, then dissapointmen t will be less because I knew this game was just a 2 day type game. anything more is a perk..

--No game deserves a ZERO! We should only be allowed so many ZERO's, or it should be monitored or controlled..I bet 90% of reviewers who attack games with a ZERO do it on a regular ****!
- I could see a 2 maybe. a ONE **** is brokem and can not be **** a ZERO is misused..
--I look forward to innovation with scoring...

before I get into it, let me states some facts: 90% of gamers are men, male gamers are more prone to enjoy violent games, the manlier the characters, the more the male gamers will enjoy it.

THAT BEING SAID.

This game is about as polished at a pile of poop. Instead of immersing you into a fantasy world where you play an orc, you come away feeling like you played a green painted, redneck with about as much nod to his own orchood, as me. They curse in English, which jars you. And, it's not even cursing to accentuate sentences. It's cursing, in the way that white frat boys curse, just to punctuate sentences. So instead of you thinking, wow these orcs are real manly tough guys, you come away thinking I WONDER DO THEY TAN IN BEDS OR OUT IN THE SUN. The voice acting doesn't help that they sound like fresh out the bed dweebs, raspy, breathy, man-voice with boy grammatical structure.

It would have been much better if the developer took the time to come up with 100 orc ""words"" and punctuate all the orc conversations with them.

That's part of what makes the genre such an addictive one. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is a slick, exciting 2D take on your typical zombie-laden shooter, with high production values and a distinct Korean flavor that helps it stand out from the rest of the pack. Save for a few missteps, it shines brightly as a surprisingly competent indie horror game that's modest yet enjoyable. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is actually a sequel to a game called The Coma: Cutting Class, which I had never heard of before jumping into this review. Fortunately, this particular entry can be played and enjoyed on its own without any prior knowledge of the original. You play as a student at Sehwa High named Mina Park. One day after school, she passed out following a shady interaction with her teacher Ms. Song and a fellow student. When Mina wakes up, she finds herself trapped in a nightmarish version of her everyday world called The Coma. With little explanation, she's suddenly chased down by a maniacal, bloodthirsty version of Ms. Song, who runs her down at every opportunity to try and stab Mina to death. Ms. Song is being controlled by what you'll soon learn is called the ""Vicious Sister,"" an entity that apparently wants Mina (and everyone else for that matter) out of the way. Mina must first escape her school and find shelter across the city as she works out a way to fell this bizarre Vicious Sister and the rest of her minions before it's too late. The game does share connections to the first Coma story, but they're mainly tangential, in that Mina is a friend of Youngho, the protagonist from the first game. But there's nothing more you really need to know to proceed, which I appreciated since I came into the story blind. Now, if I want to go back to play the first one, I've got something to go on as well. As Mina makes her way through the city, she explores a variety of locations such as the police station, a bizarre underground market, and plenty of other areas that hold the key to driving back the Vicious Sister and whatever she has planned. The gameplay loop consists of Mina exploring each area on a 2D plane, exploring rooms and passageways to find key items like keycards and maps or to deliver items to characters. Most of the time, you'll find yourself in one area on the map, and you'll need to get to another. But you won't have the item you need to get there, which means you'll need to go on a trek until you get it. This can eventually wear on the nerves because of the constant back-and-forth and backtracking, but each area is inventive enough to hold your attention. There are also usually side quests to help you out in some way, such as building an improvised taser. Whatever would you need a taser for? Well, you may have forgotten that this is a survival horror game. Where's the survival and horror come in? Right about the time you pick up the quest to make that taser. Until then, Mina is defenseless against any of the dangers in her way: falling bodies, poison clouds, ghosts that reach out to scratch you, and all that fun stuff. You can sprint around to avoid some of these things, but you need to watch your stamina and health points. Neither are unlimited, and letting them run out spells doom in some cases. But the real fun begins when Ms. Song and her cohorts start following you around. Ms. Song can appear just about anywhere on each map, or one of the baddies that follow her, and she can slash at you to quickly whittle your health down. Unfortunately, you can do little to bring it back up quickly if you really start getting in a tight spot – you get limited inventory space and it can be difficult to get to the item you need in time if it's not part of your current hot bar setup. This is where things get annoying. While you don't have much to defend yourself, Ms. Song is a walking disaster. She'll have you dead and forced to go back to a save point in the blink of an eye, which makes for some needlessly frustrating gameplay. For a good while, if you don't know your way around the map you're currently exploring, she'll just appear and slash you to death unless you can get away quickly enough to hide under a desk, in a locker, or somewhere else. You have a limited inventory, so you'll undoubtedly run out of health items before you can heal up from her repeated damage, and that makes it difficult to get past her as well. The key is hiding somewhere before she finds you (the music will swell so you know) and successfully completing a set of quick time events. Sometimes, if you hide while she can see you, those events (a few well-timed button presses) can't save you. It can get extremely frustrating until you work out a system, and admittedly I didn't find this part scary or engrossing  it was just a hindrance most of the time. A good amount of the horror n your Xbox One.",80,"As a 2D horror game, The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters manages to pull itself up in a genre filled by cliches, using its mysterious story and atmosphere to create a unique experience.",/game/the-coma-2-vicious-sisters/

You only control two characters across the entire game and with battles being largely melee-oriented you're strategic options are limited. Given how annoying it can be to queue up attacks or target specific enemies when swarmed, this is probably one of those games that fares a bit worse on consoles and would benefit from the freedom offered by a mouse-and-keyboard. The inclusion of stealth gameplay is nice, but loses some of its luster when you realize enemies completely ignore dead bodies.

The story and world are fantastic. The dynamic between the two well-realized protagonists carries the feeling of a buddy movie and the way it flip-flops the role of orcs and humans turns fantasy conventions on their head. Not everything is entirely fleshed out though. For example, one seemingly important side-character isn't fleshed out and I believe a subplot involving one of the lead's father might have been left on the cutting room floor. However, the main thread itself is excellent and the fact that I was left wanting a bit more exploration into the supporting elements should serve as a testament how compelling the setting is.

With levels being so linear funnelling you from point A to point B with little room for side excursions and player choice largely being an illusion in the narrative, I can't help but wonder if Of Orcs and Men might not have been better served as a straight action game. Because with the approach taken here actually playing through it isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world.

Thankfully its interesting…
Of Orcs and Men is an action RPG game about the struggle between Orcs and men…
Its humans vs green skins…
Here you play as 2 characters…
Arkail who is a warrior brute from the legendary Bloodjaws as well as his Goblin companion Styx who offers ranged and stealth gameplay who’s job is to help Arkail get to where he needs to go on his mission to kill the emperor and change the course of the war…
The story and characters are the best part of the game…
I laughed out loud numerous times thanks to the loudmouth Styx having no filters when talking to Arkail and other characters.. And the story is full of twists and turns that this 12 hour game is genuinely enjoyable and surprising…
You even get to make choices to change minor story outcomes
and the level design here is great...
This is a very linear game... but areas feel open and theyre crawling with enemies and equipment…
Where the game is held back though is its combat itself…
Here you can play as either Styx or Arkail... and you can switch back and forth instantaneously…
Styx, who was my favorite to play as can go into stealth mode and clear some or all of the enemies out before progressing to prevent as few combat situations as possible which is ideal..
Because the combat is just no fun...
Basically both characters are on autopilot…
You put attacks in their commands list from different fighting stances and let them do their thing...
you really don’t even have to touch the controller until late in the game if you don’t want to…
because of this put in commands combat system, you never truly feel in control…
You don’t feel like you’re using strategy to win...
just that youre desperately running around with styx throwing knives and healing Arkail so you don’t have to start again... neither of the 2 have strategy programmed into them… if you leave styx he automatically goes into close range when he has considerably less health than arkail… so hell die almost instantly…
Its almost like you really have no choice but to use him
In some instances youll get into fights after messing up a stealth kill or being seen and arkail is just standing there looking at you instead of running to help…
As you do complete battles youll level up so you can balance the characters in areas theyre weak or make them stronger in areas there already strong in.. So the juggling act isn’t as annoying…
And you can unlock new skills and upgrade them with a choice of a perk to suit your gameplay style…
but it’s a bad sign when playing your game is the worst part of your game...
its an alright time and worth experiencing..
Especially for the story, level design, and being introduced to these characters…
It’s just rough to get through…

You just go through the one-way all the time, finding enemies here and there, and sometimes you'll find a whole bunch of them, and, if you're not a hardcore, like me, you'll find some parts really annoying and impossible to past (i didn't even finish the **** game. Had to stop before start banging my head against the wall). It's shotty, if you've ever played any decent RPG you'll find this annoying in all aspects that matters. So, don't play it. It's garbage now (2015) and it was garbage when it was released.",70,"In an effort to offer the player a fresh and different experience, Of Orcs and Men ends up being a mix of elements that works quite well and others that influence the product in a very negative way.

My favourite aspects of the game are the soundtrack and story, soundtrack is excellent really entertaining and paces well with gameplay and story, the story itself is decent but is let down often by pretty lacklustre cut scenes. Rpg elements are very basic leveling is ok but there is an obvious lack of depth on the equipment end of this, armour and weapons are few and far between with little chance to actually upgrade.

~~This game was fun for me this OCTOBER 2013. And I ignored the fact that it was an old game and was wanting to spend some MONEY I HAD ON MY account. And this was worth it for a affordable game..
--Graphics aren't Last of us,Halo,Or Bioshock but does that matter on NON-blockbuster games anyways? NO! With arcade or PSN or downloadable games Graphics and voice acting need only be swervicable for our fun. Story & gameplay and unique level up or loot etc.. I enjoyed this game and if one is 100% true to themselves when they start playing it, then dissapointmen t will be less because I knew this game was just a 2 day type game. anything more is a perk..

--No game deserves a ZERO! We should only be allowed so many ZERO's, or it should be monitored or controlled..I bet 90% of reviewers who attack games with a ZERO do it on a regular ****!
- I could see a 2 maybe. a ONE **** is brokem and can not be **** a ZERO is misused..
--I look forward to innovation with scoring...

I gave this a 10 to balance out the OBVIOUS Hate-Spam that took place..
-Metacritic has a good Rep but that wont last forever.

before I get into it, let me states some facts: 90% of gamers are men, male gamers are more prone to enjoy violent games, the manlier the characters, the more the male gamers will enjoy it.

THAT BEING SAID.

This game is about as polished at a pile of poop. Instead of immersing you into a fantasy world where you play an orc, you come away feeling like you played a green painted, redneck with about as much nod to his own orchood, as me. They curse in English, which jars you. And, it's not even cursing to accentuate sentences. It's cursing, in the way that white frat boys curse, just to punctuate sentences. So instead of you thinking, wow these orcs are real manly tough guys, you come away thinking I WONDER DO THEY TAN IN BEDS OR OUT IN THE SUN. The voice acting doesn't help that they sound like fresh out the bed dweebs, raspy, breathy, man-voice with boy grammatical structure.

It would have been much better if the developer took the time to come up with 100 orc ""words"" and punctuate all the orc conversations with them.

Use everything at your disposal to avoid a demoness hellbent on killing you!,Devespresso Games,Survival,8,"The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters as in the best survival horror games have you leaping out of your seat, your pulse pounding, and sweat soaking your T-shirt. That's part of what makes the genre such an addictive one. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is a slick, exciting 2D take on your typical zombie-laden shooter, with high production values and a distinct Korean flavor that helps it stand out from the rest of the pack. Save for a few missteps, it shines brightly as a surprisingly competent indie horror game that's modest yet enjoyable. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is actually a sequel to a game called The Coma: Cutting Class, which I had never heard of before jumping into this review. Fortunately, this particular entry can be played and enjoyed on its own without any prior knowledge of the original. You play as a student at Sehwa High named Mina Park. One day after school, she passed out following a shady interaction with her teacher Ms. Song and a fellow student. When Mina wakes up, she finds herself trapped in a nightmarish version of her everyday world called The Coma. With little explanation, she's suddenly chased down by a maniacal, bloodthirsty version of Ms. Song, who runs her down at every opportunity to try and stab Mina to death. Ms. Song is being controlled by what you'll soon learn is called the ""Vicious Sister,"" an entity that apparently wants Mina (and everyone else for that matter) out of the way. Mina must first escape her school and find shelter across the city as she works out a way to fell this bizarre Vicious Sister and the rest of her minions before it's too late. The game does share connections to the first Coma story, but they're mainly tangential, in that Mina is a friend of Youngho, the protagonist from the first game. But there's nothing more you really need to know to proceed, which I appreciated since I came into the story blind. Now, if I want to go back to play the first one, I've got something to go on as well. As Mina makes her way through the city, she explores a variety of locations such as the police station, a bizarre underground market, and plenty of other areas that hold the key to driving back the Vicious Sister and whatever she has planned. The gameplay loop consists of Mina exploring each area on a 2D plane, exploring rooms and passageways to find key items like keycards and maps or to deliver items to characters. Most of the time, you'll find yourself in one area on the map, and you'll need to get to another. But you won't have the item you need to get there, which means you'll need to go on a trek until you get it. This can eventually wear on the nerves because of the constant back-and-forth and backtracking, but each area is inventive enough to hold your attention. There are also usually side quests to help you out in some way, such as building an improvised taser. Whatever would you need a taser for? Well, you may have forgotten that this is a survival horror game. Where's the survival and horror come in? Right about the time you pick up the quest to make that taser. Until then, Mina is defenseless against any of the dangers in her way: falling bodies, poison clouds, ghosts that reach out to scratch you, and all that fun stuff. You can sprint around to avoid some of these things, but you need to watch your stamina and health points. Neither are unlimited, and letting them run out spells doom in some cases. But the real fun begins when Ms. Song and her cohorts start following you around. Ms. Song can appear just about anywhere on each map, or one of the baddies that follow her, and she can slash at you to quickly whittle your health down. Unfortunately, you can do little to bring it back up quickly if you really start getting in a tight spot – you get limited inventory space and it can be difficult to get to the item you need in time if it's not part of your current hot bar setup. This is where things get annoying. While you don't have much to defend yourself, Ms. Song is a walking disaster. She'll have you dead and forced to go back to a save point in the blink of an eye, which makes for some needlessly frustrating gameplay. For a good while, if you don't know your way around the map you're currently exploring, she'll just appear and slash you to death unless you can get away quickly enough to hide under a desk, in a locker, or somewhere else. You have a limited inventory, so you'll undoubtedly run out of health items before you can heal up from her repeated damage, and that makes it difficult to get past her as well. The key is hiding somewhere before she finds you (the music will swell so you know) and successfully completing a set of quick time events. Sometimes, if you hide while she can see you, those events (a few well-timed button presses) can't save you. It can get extremely frustrating until you work out a system, and admittedly I didn't find this part scary or engrossing  it was just a hindrance most of the time. A good amount of the horror n your Xbox One.",80,"As a 2D horror game, The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters manages to pull itself up in a genre filled by cliches, using its mysterious story and atmosphere to create a unique experience.",/game/the-coma-2-vicious-sisters/

I actually played it from start to finish in one sitting. I think it took around 3 to 4 hours to beat the first level of difficulty. There is three different levels of difficulty so this one is going to keep you busy a long time. That was playing it solo. you might be able to do it a little quicker with help. It has 2-4 player local coop. I imagine that would be a ton of fun I'll have to try it out next time I got friends over. As far as playing it solo it's challenging, but not to the point it's frustrating. I died a few times, but usually beat the level the next try. There are tons of levels. I didn't count them, but It's a really large map. It's loaded with levels. Each one spiking in difficulty as you go. Usually they introduce a new weapon, enemy, or ability as you go as well. There is tons of content and daily objectives that really add a lot of replay value to this one.

You play as Tesla, and use many of his great inventions to take out Lovecraft and his many monsters. You have pistols, shotguns, energy weapons, and so so much more even EPIC weapons. So many weapons and even a Mech. You start each level with the Mech until it runs down, then you have to collect pieces of it to reassemble it to use again. You can also upgrade it to where it lasts longer. That is one of your many upgrades available to you. You upgrade using crystals you find while playing. There is just so many things in this game to make it feel fresh and fun from start to finish. Like Perks you will find as you play. each time you level up on a level you will get two random perks to choose from. Perks like 30%  more health, 20% more weapon damage, bouncing bullets, and so much more. No way I could name them all. Like i said tons and tons of content.

Weapons, Perks, and upgrades aren't the only thing there is tons of. Monsters galore !!! You will come across so many variations of monsters. each with different attacks and abilities. Some will explode leaving fire on the ground, some will shoot things at you, some will just run you down and try and melee you. There are a few bosses as well. I believe 3 to 4 of them. The final confrontation with Lovecraft is also very action packed and unforgettable. I also really enjoyed the art style in the cut scenes. I was pulled into the really entertaining about some really legendary characters. Tesla and Lovecraft are timeless characters in history, and this game does a excellent job of introducing them to a new generation of gamers.",80,"10tons Ltd has managed to find extraordinary margins within the genre as restricted as top-down shooters.

Visually beautiful although there is not much variation.

REGARDING THE DIFFICULTY CURVE: The first of the 3 realms is a fair challenge.  Its nice to earn new weapons and new perks.  By the time you get to the 2nd realm, the difficulty really ramps up.  I would have like to have seen a smoother increase in difficulty over the 3 realms.  At the beginning of the 2nd realm, you will start to encounter levels that seem near impossible.
Collecting crystals to upgrade or unlock abilities is very time consuming, but if you love the game-play, then its worth it.

Each level will either task the player with mowing down waves of enemies thrown at them, or completing basic tasks such as collecting items or destroying other non-threatening objects. Each level can be completed between a few seconds and a few minutes, with an entire playthrough on a single difficulty lasting a few hours through its 20+ levels. That said, there’s a decent amount of content to be found in this title.

After completing a few tutorial levels and collecting all of the pieces needed to assemble your mech suit, you will begin each level in the suit, which is a limited ability that will drain quickly. Once it has been depleted you can collect the pieces again, as they will respawn at random points in the level and once complete, and you can activate the ability again at your leisure. In addition to the mech, you can teleport or dash through enemies and obstacles, which makes traversing the level and avoiding enemies quite easy on the standard difficulty. This ability can be used multiple times in succession and has a fairly quick recharge rate.

The arsenal at your disposal is pretty normal for this type of game. You’ll start each level with a basic pistol and typically find various types of shotguns, machine guns, but being that this is Tesla, you’ll also find a gun that shoots lightning balls. You are able to carry one crowd-control ability in addition to one weapon at a time. While the abilities are limited to a set number of uses, the weapons feature unlimited ammo, although they must be reloaded. The biggest game changer will be the perks that modify how your weapons fire, with upgrades such as ammo bouncing off of walls, piercing groups of enemies, or multiple bullets being fired at the same time being up for grabs. I found the repeater shotgun (basically a fully automatic version) with the multi-shot and bouncing effects to be the most worthwhile. When you end up with a good roll, it’s amazing.

During standard play you’ll level up Tesla and be given the option between one of two perks to apply to the character. The upgrades stack, so if you’re lucky enough to get multiples of the more devastating perks, you’ll want to take advantage of them. These come fairly often, but reset each time the player leaves the level, giving the title a rouge-lite feel. This works for the most part but can add frustration as well. Since the upgrades and weapons available are randomized, some of the more difficult levels will be harder if you don’t find something to even out the playing field, resulting in multiple attempts to complete the level.

There are also permanent upgrades that can be applied to your character. These require the player to collect crystals that are rewarded for killing X number of a certain enemy, finishing levels, completing weekly bounties, and will appear randomly in higher levels as pickups. These upgrades do not change gameplay as much as the perks do mid-game, but they will help the player once reaching the higher difficulties. The biggest issue with these is the cost of the upgrades compared to how often you accrue them not being balanced. Having completed the first difficulty and being half way through the second as of this writing, I have only been able to purchase a few of these.

Offering the high level of polish that 10tons LTD has been known for in its previous releases (Time Recoil, Jydge), the game controls like it should. The only thing I would have changed would have been removing the right trigger requirement to shoot and simply use the right stick. The enemies you face are well rendered and rarely blend into the level, which has been a bit of a setback in previous shmups. With the visuals being on par with most indie games you’ll find on the market, the graphics won’t disappoint, but are nothing to write home about. You’ll face off against spiders, blobs, and strange tentacles, among other ghastly stylized creatures that spew a respectable amount of purple blood upon death. While the bosses are simply larger versions of the normal enemies, they pose a decent challenge and require the player to strategically choose their upgrades early in these encounters.

If you would like to take a friend with you on your journey into madness, the game offers local co-op play. Sadly, I did not have a companion available to play with, so I cannot comment on how well this works. For those that are into endless modes, the game has you covered, with the option being unlocked early into the game. If you’re a fan of the shmup genre or 10tons Ltd’s other work, you won’t be disappointed.",80,"You may initially think that 10tons have gone mad by pitting the brains of Nikola Tesla against the weirdness of H.P. Lovecraft – and you’d be right. But whilst they are mad, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are wrong and once more they’ve managed to create another addictive little twin stick shooter.",/game/tesla-vs-lovecraft/

Genre hallmarks such as a large arsenal of weapons, a multitude of player empowering perks, monster crushing powerups, and secondary weapon abilities are also included.",10tons,Top-Down Shoot-'Em-Up,8,"The twin-stick shooting genre has been going for a long while now and over the years its spawned some classics which have made this particular genre my go to genre. Tesla vs Lovecraft is the latest twin-stick shooter to come to the fore and whilst it doesn’t offer anything different from what you’ve already seen before it still manages to provide you with more than enough enjoyable moments. The gameplay that’s on offer in the game is an incredible amount of fun and the best thing is that the shooting elements remain tight and responsive throughout your playthrough. Whilst I enjoyed the gameplay a lot it does however get a little too difficult at times and it will cause you to have a few frustrating moments every now and then, but they do however do a good job of combating this problem. They combat this problem by offering you a co-op option and not only does that make things easier it also makes things more fun and enjoyable at the same time. In terms of content the game has more than enough for you to be getting on with and with the added unlockables the game is likely to keep you satisfied for quite a while. Some of the unlockables and perks though are unfortunately a little lacklustre and don’t improve you much, but thankfully most of them have been designed really well and they certainly beef up your attack. Something that surprised me about Tesla vs Lovecraft was the amount of stages the game has. There are an abundance of stages for you to sink your teeth into and the best thing is that each stage has a lot of variety present in them so that without a doubt keeps things fresh and interesting for longer. The game also has the bonus of a decent story and I found that it interacted with the gameplay extremely well, which is great. The presentation side of the game disappointed me a little bit and I was just hoping for a little bit more. Don’t get me wrong there is nothing bad here its just there isn’t much that stands out which can make things become a little tedious at times. At the end of the day as far as twin-stick shooters go Tesla vs Lovecraft is a decent addition to the genre. Don’t get me wrong there are better games out there, but it doesn’t get too much wrong and the stuff it does get right is the most important of elements. If you’re after a game that provides you with a lot of fun whilst retaining a challenge at the same time then you can do much worse than Tesla vs Lovecraft, and for that reason it gets a nice thumbs up from me.",80,"Tesla vs Lovecraft is a great twin-stick shooter. I liked 10tons’ previous efforts, and I think this one is very satisfying to play. Its enemies, guns, perks and abilities are all varied and play well with each other, and the first time I stacked several 'one extra projectile fired per shot' perks and jumped in my mech, I couldn’t help but grin at the hail of bullets I was unleashing.",/game/tesla-vs-lovecraft/

As a veteran warrior who has seen the most brutal of battles, you are appointed by the Orc commander to complete a mission that could change the course of the war: kill the one man responsible for all of this bloodshed, the one who has, for years, exhorted the human masses to loath and fight the green-skinned people: the Emperor himself.",Cyanide,Western RPG,6,"Really wants to be Dragon Age: Origins, but ultimately can't achieve the same level of depth when it comes to the mix of real-time and tactical combat. You only control two characters across the entire game and with battles being largely melee-oriented you're strategic options are limited. Given how annoying it can be to queue up attacks or target specific enemies when swarmed, this is probably one of those games that fares a bit worse on consoles and would benefit from the freedom offered by a mouse-and-keyboard. The inclusion of stealth gameplay is nice, but loses some of its luster when you realize enemies completely ignore dead bodies.

The story and world are fantastic. The dynamic between the two well-realized protagonists carries the feeling of a buddy movie and the way it flip-flops the role of orcs and humans turns fantasy conventions on their head. Not everything is entirely fleshed out though. For example, one seemingly important side-character isn't fleshed out and I believe a subplot involving one of the lead's father might have been left on the cutting room floor. However, the main thread itself is excellent and the fact that I was left wanting a bit more exploration into the supporting elements should serve as a testament how compelling the setting is.

With levels being so linear funnelling you from point A to point B with little room for side excursions and player choice largely being an illusion in the narrative, I can't help but wonder if Of Orcs and Men might not have been better served as a straight action game. Because with the approach taken here actually playing through it isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world. It's just worth it for the concept.",80,"Of Orcs And Men has not had a great marketing campaign, and this is the reason it will be considered a surprise by many.

Thankfully its interesting…
Of Orcs and Men is an action RPG game about the struggle between Orcs and men…
Its humans vs green skins…
Here you play as 2 characters…
Arkail who is a warrior brute from the legendary Bloodjaws as well as his Goblin companion Styx who offers ranged and stealth gameplay who’s job is to help Arkail get to where he needs to go on his mission to kill the emperor and change the course of the war…
The story and characters are the best part of the game…
I laughed out loud numerous times thanks to the loudmouth Styx having no filters when talking to Arkail and other characters.. And the story is full of twists and turns that this 12 hour game is genuinely enjoyable and surprising…
You even get to make choices to change minor story outcomes
and the level design here is great...
This is a very linear game... but areas feel open and theyre crawling with enemies and equipment…
Where the game is held back though is its combat itself…
Here you can play as either Styx or Arkail... and you can switch back and forth instantaneously…
Styx, who was my favorite to play as can go into stealth mode and clear some or all of the enemies out before progressing to prevent as few combat situations as possible which is ideal..
Because the combat is just no fun...
Basically both characters are on autopilot…
You put attacks in their commands list from different fighting stances and let them do their thing...
you really don’t even have to touch the controller until late in the game if you don’t want to…
because of this put in commands combat system, you never truly feel in control…
You don’t feel like you’re using strategy to win...
just that youre desperately running around with styx throwing knives and healing Arkail so you don’t have to start again... neither of the 2 have strategy programmed into them… if you leave styx he automatically goes into close range when he has considerably less health than arkail… so hell die almost instantly…
Its almost like you really have no choice but to use him
In some instances youll get into fights after messing up a stealth kill or being seen and arkail is just standing there looking at you instead of running to help…
As you do complete battles youll level up so you can balance the characters in areas theyre weak or make them stronger in areas there already strong in.. So the juggling act isn’t as annoying…
And you can unlock new skills and upgrade them with a choice of a perk to suit your gameplay style…
but it’s a bad sign when playing your game is the worst part of your game...
its an alright time and worth experiencing..
Especially for the story, level design, and being introduced to these characters…
It’s just rough to get through…

A 6.5/10",79,"Of Orcs and Men might seem like a traditional role-playing game, but it turns the roles of heroes and villains upside down.

before I get into it, let me states some facts: 90% of gamers are men, male gamers are more prone to enjoy violent games, the manlier the characters, the more the male gamers will enjoy it.

THAT BEING SAID.

This game is about as polished at a pile of poop. Instead of immersing you into a fantasy world where you play an orc, you come away feeling like you played a green painted, redneck with about as much nod to his own orchood, as me. They curse in English, which jars you. And, it's not even cursing to accentuate sentences. It's cursing, in the way that white frat boys curse, just to punctuate sentences. So instead of you thinking, wow these orcs are real manly tough guys, you come away thinking I WONDER DO THEY TAN IN BEDS OR OUT IN THE SUN. The voice acting doesn't help that they sound like fresh out the bed dweebs, raspy, breathy, man-voice with boy grammatical structure.

That's part of what makes the genre such an addictive one. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is a slick, exciting 2D take on your typical zombie-laden shooter, with high production values and a distinct Korean flavor that helps it stand out from the rest of the pack. Save for a few missteps, it shines brightly as a surprisingly competent indie horror game that's modest yet enjoyable. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is actually a sequel to a game called The Coma: Cutting Class, which I had never heard of before jumping into this review. Fortunately, this particular entry can be played and enjoyed on its own without any prior knowledge of the original. You play as a student at Sehwa High named Mina Park. One day after school, she passed out following a shady interaction with her teacher Ms. Song and a fellow student. When Mina wakes up, she finds herself trapped in a nightmarish version of her everyday world called The Coma. With little explanation, she's suddenly chased down by a maniacal, bloodthirsty version of Ms. Song, who runs her down at every opportunity to try and stab Mina to death. Ms. Song is being controlled by what you'll soon learn is called the ""Vicious Sister,"" an entity that apparently wants Mina (and everyone else for that matter) out of the way. Mina must first escape her school and find shelter across the city as she works out a way to fell this bizarre Vicious Sister and the rest of her minions before it's too late. The game does share connections to the first Coma story, but they're mainly tangential, in that Mina is a friend of Youngho, the protagonist from the first game. But there's nothing more you really need to know to proceed, which I appreciated since I came into the story blind. Now, if I want to go back to play the first one, I've got something to go on as well. As Mina makes her way through the city, she explores a variety of locations such as the police station, a bizarre underground market, and plenty of other areas that hold the key to driving back the Vicious Sister and whatever she has planned. The gameplay loop consists of Mina exploring each area on a 2D plane, exploring rooms and passageways to find key items like keycards and maps or to deliver items to characters. Most of the time, you'll find yourself in one area on the map, and you'll need to get to another. But you won't have the item you need to get there, which means you'll need to go on a trek until you get it. This can eventually wear on the nerves because of the constant back-and-forth and backtracking, but each area is inventive enough to hold your attention. There are also usually side quests to help you out in some way, such as building an improvised taser. Whatever would you need a taser for? Well, you may have forgotten that this is a survival horror game. Where's the survival and horror come in? Right about the time you pick up the quest to make that taser. Until then, Mina is defenseless against any of the dangers in her way: falling bodies, poison clouds, ghosts that reach out to scratch you, and all that fun stuff. You can sprint around to avoid some of these things, but you need to watch your stamina and health points. Neither are unlimited, and letting them run out spells doom in some cases. But the real fun begins when Ms. Song and her cohorts start following you around. Ms. Song can appear just about anywhere on each map, or one of the baddies that follow her, and she can slash at you to quickly whittle your health down. Unfortunately, you can do little to bring it back up quickly if you really start getting in a tight spot – you get limited inventory space and it can be difficult to get to the item you need in time if it's not part of your current hot bar setup. This is where things get annoying. While you don't have much to defend yourself, Ms. Song is a walking disaster. She'll have you dead and forced to go back to a save point in the blink of an eye, which makes for some needlessly frustrating gameplay. For a good while, if you don't know your way around the map you're currently exploring, she'll just appear and slash you to death unless you can get away quickly enough to hide under a desk, in a locker, or somewhere else. You have a limited inventory, so you'll undoubtedly run out of health items before you can heal up from her repeated damage, and that makes it difficult to get past her as well. The key is hiding somewhere before she finds you (the music will swell so you know) and successfully completing a set of quick time events. Sometimes, if you hide while she can see you, those events (a few well-timed button presses) can't save you. It can get extremely frustrating until you work out a system, and admittedly I didn't find this part scary or engrossing  it was just a hindrance most of the time.

I actually played it from start to finish in one sitting. I think it took around 3 to 4 hours to beat the first level of difficulty. There is three different levels of difficulty so this one is going to keep you busy a long time. That was playing it solo. you might be able to do it a little quicker with help. It has 2-4 player local coop. I imagine that would be a ton of fun I'll have to try it out next time I got friends over. As far as playing it solo it's challenging, but not to the point it's frustrating. I died a few times, but usually beat the level the next try. There are tons of levels. I didn't count them, but It's a really large map. It's loaded with levels. Each one spiking in difficulty as you go. Usually they introduce a new weapon, enemy, or ability as you go as well. There is tons of content and daily objectives that really add a lot of replay value to this one.

You play as Tesla, and use many of his great inventions to take out Lovecraft and his many monsters. You have pistols, shotguns, energy weapons, and so so much more even EPIC weapons. So many weapons and even a Mech. You start each level with the Mech until it runs down, then you have to collect pieces of it to reassemble it to use again. You can also upgrade it to where it lasts longer. That is one of your many upgrades available to you. You upgrade using crystals you find while playing. There is just so many things in this game to make it feel fresh and fun from start to finish. Like Perks you will find as you play. each time you level up on a level you will get two random perks to choose from. Perks like 30%  more health, 20% more weapon damage, bouncing bullets, and so much more. No way I could name them all. Like i said tons and tons of content.

Weapons, Perks, and upgrades aren't the only thing there is tons of. Monsters galore !!! You will come across so many variations of monsters. each with different attacks and abilities. Some will explode leaving fire on the ground, some will shoot things at you, some will just run you down and try and melee you. There are a few bosses as well. I believe 3 to 4 of them. The final confrontation with Lovecraft is also very action packed and unforgettable. I also really enjoyed the art style in the cut scenes. I was pulled into the really entertaining about some really legendary characters. Tesla and Lovecraft are timeless characters in history, and this game does a excellent job of introducing them to a new generation of gamers.",80,"10tons Ltd has managed to find extraordinary margins within the genre as restricted as top-down shooters.

Visually beautiful although there is not much variation.
Gun, ability, and perk selections are outstanding.  I do wish however that there was a way to lock in with a specific weapon once you acquire it.
REGARDING THE DIFFICULTY CURVE: The first of the 3 realms is a fair challenge.  Its nice to earn new weapons and new perks.  By the time you get to the 2nd realm, the difficulty really ramps up.  I would have like to have seen a smoother increase in difficulty over the 3 realms.  At the beginning of the 2nd realm, you will start to encounter levels that seem near impossible.
Collecting crystals to upgrade or unlock abilities is very time consuming, but if you love the game-play, then its worth it.

Genre hallmarks such as a large arsenal of weapons, a multitude of player empowering perks, monster crushing powerups, and secondary weapon abilities are also included.",10tons,Top-Down Shoot-'Em-Up,8,"You’ll step into the shoes of Tesla as he takes down the forces of Lovecraft across multiple areas using a mech, standard weaponry, as well as some designs by the legendary inventor himself. Each level will either task the player with mowing down waves of enemies thrown at them, or completing basic tasks such as collecting items or destroying other non-threatening objects. Each level can be completed between a few seconds and a few minutes, with an entire playthrough on a single difficulty lasting a few hours through its 20+ levels. That said, there’s a decent amount of content to be found in this title.

After completing a few tutorial levels and collecting all of the pieces needed to assemble your mech suit, you will begin each level in the suit, which is a limited ability that will drain quickly. Once it has been depleted you can collect the pieces again, as they will respawn at random points in the level and once complete, and you can activate the ability again at your leisure. In addition to the mech, you can teleport or dash through enemies and obstacles, which makes traversing the level and avoiding enemies quite easy on the standard difficulty. This ability can be used multiple times in succession and has a fairly quick recharge rate.

The arsenal at your disposal is pretty normal for this type of game. You’ll start each level with a basic pistol and typically find various types of shotguns, machine guns, but being that this is Tesla, you’ll also find a gun that shoots lightning balls. You are able to carry one crowd-control ability in addition to one weapon at a time. While the abilities are limited to a set number of uses, the weapons feature unlimited ammo, although they must be reloaded. The biggest game changer will be the perks that modify how your weapons fire, with upgrades such as ammo bouncing off of walls, piercing groups of enemies, or multiple bullets being fired at the same time being up for grabs. I found the repeater shotgun (basically a fully automatic version) with the multi-shot and bouncing effects to be the most worthwhile. When you end up with a good roll, it’s amazing.

During standard play you’ll level up Tesla and be given the option between one of two perks to apply to the character. The upgrades stack, so if you’re lucky enough to get multiples of the more devastating perks, you’ll want to take advantage of them. These come fairly often, but reset each time the player leaves the level, giving the title a rouge-lite feel. This works for the most part but can add frustration as well. Since the upgrades and weapons available are randomized, some of the more difficult levels will be harder if you don’t find something to even out the playing field, resulting in multiple attempts to complete the level.

There are also permanent upgrades that can be applied to your character. These require the player to collect crystals that are rewarded for killing X number of a certain enemy, finishing levels, completing weekly bounties, and will appear randomly in higher levels as pickups. These upgrades do not change gameplay as much as the perks do mid-game, but they will help the player once reaching the higher difficulties. The biggest issue with these is the cost of the upgrades compared to how often you accrue them not being balanced. Having completed the first difficulty and being half way through the second as of this writing, I have only been able to purchase a few of these.

Offering the high level of polish that 10tons LTD has been known for in its previous releases (Time Recoil, Jydge), the game controls like it should. The only thing I would have changed would have been removing the right trigger requirement to shoot and simply use the right stick. The enemies you face are well rendered and rarely blend into the level, which has been a bit of a setback in previous shmups. With the visuals being on par with most indie games you’ll find on the market, the graphics won’t disappoint, but are nothing to write home about. You’ll face off against spiders, blobs, and strange tentacles, among other ghastly stylized creatures that spew a respectable amount of purple blood upon death. While the bosses are simply larger versions of the normal enemies, they pose a decent challenge and require the player to strategically choose their upgrades early in these encounters.

If you would like to take a friend with you on your journey into madness, the game offers local co-op play. Sadly, I did not have a companion available to play with, so I cannot comment on how well this works. For those that are into endless modes, the game has you covered, with the option being unlocked early into the game. If you’re a fan of the shmup genre or 10tons Ltd’s other work, you won’t be disappointed.",80,"You may initially think that 10tons have gone mad by pitting the brains of Nikola Tesla against the weirdness of H.P.

The gameplay that’s on offer in the game is an incredible amount of fun and the best thing is that the shooting elements remain tight and responsive throughout your playthrough. Whilst I enjoyed the gameplay a lot it does however get a little too difficult at times and it will cause you to have a few frustrating moments every now and then, but they do however do a good job of combating this problem. They combat this problem by offering you a co-op option and not only does that make things easier it also makes things more fun and enjoyable at the same time. In terms of content the game has more than enough for you to be getting on with and with the added unlockables the game is likely to keep you satisfied for quite a while. Some of the unlockables and perks though are unfortunately a little lacklustre and don’t improve you much, but thankfully most of them have been designed really well and they certainly beef up your attack. Something that surprised me about Tesla vs Lovecraft was the amount of stages the game has. There are an abundance of stages for you to sink your teeth into and the best thing is that each stage has a lot of variety present in them so that without a doubt keeps things fresh and interesting for longer. The game also has the bonus of a decent story and I found that it interacted with the gameplay extremely well, which is great. The presentation side of the game disappointed me a little bit and I was just hoping for a little bit more.

Many of the elam are in denial, but some of them want to take the radical step of allowing banlits, including women, into the Guild.",Spellbind Studios,Roguelike,8,"Hi guys, let's discuss Rogue Wizards for a bit here shall we..

First of all, this game reminds me greatly of the 'Braveland Trilogy' and that being said you can already create a pretty good idea about, ''if you're actually going to like it or not'' because i know such games might be a bit too boring for some.. I'm a bit **** so i guess i couldn't go wrong with owning a copy of this nice looking and fun to play game.
But again, it's just like i said before, you'll either going to love or hate it but that doesn't make this a bad game if you don't like it.
And that's precisely why i'm letting you guys know, why i personally like this game a lot.

Let's talk about the graphics: The game looks pretty nice and cartooney (like Braveland and such) and the animations are nicely done although don't expect blitzes all over the screen or bright flashes because this game is by all means not a AAA graphical masterpiece! But all in all, it looks pretty nice, it doesn't glitch and it works well with everything else.. So what's not good about that, right?
Let's talk about the music/sound: The music for this game is pretty much kept simple although the tunes are catchy and the animation/effects etc all sound just as one would expect from such a game. It works pretty well together impo.
Now let's talk about the gameplay: The gameplay is set up in turnbased mode as soon as you encounter enemies or obstacles such as hidden traps etc. The grid/map is also devided in tiles, so each step you make will be on one of those tiles each turn. While in battle (outside battle those limitations are absent) you'll need to do some planning as to whether to move, change weapons, cast spells or heal yourself during the turn/time you're given. Everything is done in steps so make note of that when you're used to playing a dungeon crawler and you like to rush in like Rambo because this is not such a game.. You will be whimpy at first, but soon enough you'll be wearing nice armor, wielding massive weapons and using destructive spells (you can explore, craft/sell stuff) all at the same time which i personally think is a really nice way to let you as a player experiment freely. Also you'll earn a ton of experience along the many main and sub quests, so each time you earn a level up you can invest those points into 3 separate skills such as Power, Finesse, and Stamina. (and you'll unlock more buildings along the way too that upgrade/sell you all kinds of neat stuff..)

There are 3 primary character based skills, namely: 'Power, Finesse and Stamina'..
Power: Speaks for itself as it will allow the player to boost the strength of the character, including increasing the damage output for all his attacks.
Finesse: Is your basic dodge, shield, luck counter that will affect pretty much everything you do so don't ignore that skill!
Stamina: Works hand in hand with Power, because both make sure you can remain longer in tough battles while making it possible to dish out a world of hurt to those that seek to end you (it's a Roguelike right)..
However, you're always accompanied by 1 or two minions etc that can usually hold their own pretty well, unless cornered by bosses or packs of poisonous blobs etc.
After completing missions you will be rewarded by gaining additional magic points that you can freely spend in the magic skills department which is always helpful when you would or better said will be encountering tougher enemies and bosses. Note that each enemy has resistances and weaknesses so make sure to spend those points at the earliest sign you're encountering foes that are immune to your current skill/weapon sets etc.
Don't worry though, because you can freely adjust your character within any level so just keep your eyes open when you're facing an enemy because it will be made clearly visible as to what his/her strengths and weaknesses are.

I can say much more about this fun game, but it is probably best that i don't spoil you guys too much and so all that's really left for me to say is, get the game at a sales and play it just like i did and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as i do too.

It certainly is better than Dragon Fin Soup ... but significantly worse than SotS the Pit.

pro:

- nice graphical style (although minimal animations)
- engaging concept of turn based simultanous moving/acting
- interesting item levelling system

con:

- visual grid is WAAY too small - limiting the view distance to something like dense fog
- sound and music are rather poor
- Monster balancing is rather bad in my opinion. Too many monsters have abilities that are unavoidable and/or able to stun-lock the player. Furthermore bosses dish out and take damage hundredfold (or so it seems) compared to normal mobs. I had a boss that would have an unavoidable ranged attack from the very fringe of my vision - that would one-hit-kill my fully healthy character. All other mobs up to that boss followed a steady but easily managable difficulty curve.
- The game only allows the player to craft the very important potions at randomly spawned cauldrons. At the same time it does not allow the player to own more than 5 potions at any given time. Health is not regenerating - and as said before - many attacks are unavoidable.
It comes down to very unfair situations where you ran out of health potions - with no means of healing up... no matter how careful you proceeded.

However - as it stands ... this would be a great game for tablet and/or mobile phone ... kind of. But for PC ... it is too simplistic, too flawed to be anything but average at best (and because there are not too many games around that do the same)

If you do like dungeon crawlers with permadeath, procedural generated environment, lots of equipment, crafting and simultanous semi turn based acting .... i suggest you get Sword of the Stars the Pit ... it is superior in every way.",70,"Rogue Wizards is a solid casual roguelike with unique monster designs, perpetually generated dungeons and 10-12 hours of story-mode gameplay.

You only control two characters across the entire game and with battles being largely melee-oriented you're strategic options are limited. Given how annoying it can be to queue up attacks or target specific enemies when swarmed, this is probably one of those games that fares a bit worse on consoles and would benefit from the freedom offered by a mouse-and-keyboard. The inclusion of stealth gameplay is nice, but loses some of its luster when you realize enemies completely ignore dead bodies.

The story and world are fantastic. The dynamic between the two well-realized protagonists carries the feeling of a buddy movie and the way it flip-flops the role of orcs and humans turns fantasy conventions on their head. Not everything is entirely fleshed out though. For example, one seemingly important side-character isn't fleshed out and I believe a subplot involving one of the lead's father might have been left on the cutting room floor. However, the main thread itself is excellent and the fact that I was left wanting a bit more exploration into the supporting elements should serve as a testament how compelling the setting is.

With levels being so linear funnelling you from point A to point B with little room for side excursions and player choice largely being an illusion in the narrative, I can't help but wonder if Of Orcs and Men might not have been better served as a straight action game.

Thankfully its interesting…
Of Orcs and Men is an action RPG game about the struggle between Orcs and men…
Its humans vs green skins…
Here you play as 2 characters…
Arkail who is a warrior brute from the legendary Bloodjaws as well as his Goblin companion Styx who offers ranged and stealth gameplay who’s job is to help Arkail get to where he needs to go on his mission to kill the emperor and change the course of the war…
The story and characters are the best part of the game…
I laughed out loud numerous times thanks to the loudmouth Styx having no filters when talking to Arkail and other characters.. And the story is full of twists and turns that this 12 hour game is genuinely enjoyable and surprising…
You even get to make choices to change minor story outcomes
and the level design here is great...
This is a very linear game... but areas feel open and theyre crawling with enemies and equipment…
Where the game is held back though is its combat itself…
Here you can play as either Styx or Arkail... and you can switch back and forth instantaneously…
Styx, who was my favorite to play as can go into stealth mode and clear some or all of the enemies out before progressing to prevent as few combat situations as possible which is ideal..
Because the combat is just no fun...
Basically both characters are on autopilot…
You put attacks in their commands list from different fighting stances and let them do their thing...
you really don’t even have to touch the controller until late in the game if you don’t want to…
because of this put in commands combat system, you never truly feel in control…
You don’t feel like you’re using strategy to win...
just that youre desperately running around with styx throwing knives and healing Arkail so you don’t have to start again... neither of the 2 have strategy programmed into them… if you leave styx he automatically goes into close range when he has considerably less health than arkail… so hell die almost instantly…
Its almost like you really have no choice but to use him
In some instances youll get into fights after messing up a stealth kill or being seen and arkail is just standing there looking at you instead of running to help…
As you do complete battles youll level up so you can balance the characters in areas theyre weak or make them stronger in areas there already strong in.. So the juggling act isn’t as annoying…
And you can unlock new skills and upgrade them with a choice of a perk to suit your gameplay style…
but it’s a bad sign when playing your game is the worst part of your game...
its an alright time and worth experiencing..
Especially for the story, level design, and being introduced to these characters…
It’s just rough to get through…

The game comes with one nice story (even though it looks like Dragon Age sometimes), but all the pretty story gets lost with the poor voicing, worst gameplay, pitty animations and not a little immersive world. You just go through the one-way all the time, finding enemies here and there, and sometimes you'll find a whole bunch of them, and, if you're not a hardcore, like me, you'll find some parts really annoying and impossible to past (i didn't even finish the **** game. Had to stop before start banging my head against the wall). It's shotty, if you've ever played any decent RPG you'll find this annoying in all aspects that matters. So, don't play it.

My favourite aspects of the game are the soundtrack and story, soundtrack is excellent really entertaining and paces well with gameplay and story, the story itself is decent but is let down often by pretty lacklustre cut scenes. Rpg elements are very basic leveling is ok but there is an obvious lack of depth on the equipment end of this, armour and weapons are few and far between with little chance to actually upgrade.

~~This game was fun for me this OCTOBER 2013. And I ignored the fact that it was an old game and was wanting to spend some MONEY I HAD ON MY account. And this was worth it for a affordable game..
--Graphics aren't Last of us,Halo,Or Bioshock but does that matter on NON-blockbuster games anyways? NO! With arcade or PSN or downloadable games Graphics and voice acting need only be swervicable for our fun. Story & gameplay and unique level up or loot etc.. I enjoyed this game and if one is 100% true to themselves when they start playing it, then dissapointmen t will be less because I knew this game was just a 2 day type game. anything more is a perk..

--No game deserves a ZERO! We should only be allowed so many ZERO's, or it should be monitored or controlled..I bet 90% of reviewers who attack games with a ZERO do it on a regular ****!
- I could see a 2 maybe. a ONE **** is brokem and can not be **** a ZERO is misused..
--I look forward to innovation with scoring...

I gave this a 10 to balance out the OBVIOUS Hate-Spam that took place..
-Metacritic has a good Rep but that wont last forever.

before I get into it, let me states some facts: 90% of gamers are men, male gamers are more prone to enjoy violent games, the manlier the characters, the more the male gamers will enjoy it.

THAT BEING SAID.

This game is about as polished at a pile of poop. Instead of immersing you into a fantasy world where you play an orc, you come away feeling like you played a green painted, redneck with about as much nod to his own orchood, as me. They curse in English, which jars you. And, it's not even cursing to accentuate sentences. It's cursing, in the way that white frat boys curse, just to punctuate sentences. So instead of you thinking, wow these orcs are real manly tough guys, you come away thinking I WONDER DO THEY TAN IN BEDS OR OUT IN THE SUN. The voice acting doesn't help that they sound like fresh out the bed dweebs, raspy, breathy, man-voice with boy grammatical structure.

It would have been much better if the developer took the time to come up with 100 orc ""words"" and punctuate all the orc conversations with them.

That's part of what makes the genre such an addictive one. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is a slick, exciting 2D take on your typical zombie-laden shooter, with high production values and a distinct Korean flavor that helps it stand out from the rest of the pack. Save for a few missteps, it shines brightly as a surprisingly competent indie horror game that's modest yet enjoyable. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is actually a sequel to a game called The Coma: Cutting Class, which I had never heard of before jumping into this review. Fortunately, this particular entry can be played and enjoyed on its own without any prior knowledge of the original. You play as a student at Sehwa High named Mina Park. One day after school, she passed out following a shady interaction with her teacher Ms. Song and a fellow student. When Mina wakes up, she finds herself trapped in a nightmarish version of her everyday world called The Coma. With little explanation, she's suddenly chased down by a maniacal, bloodthirsty version of Ms. Song, who runs her down at every opportunity to try and stab Mina to death. Ms. Song is being controlled by what you'll soon learn is called the ""Vicious Sister,"" an entity that apparently wants Mina (and everyone else for that matter) out of the way. Mina must first escape her school and find shelter across the city as she works out a way to fell this bizarre Vicious Sister and the rest of her minions before it's too late. The game does share connections to the first Coma story, but they're mainly tangential, in that Mina is a friend of Youngho, the protagonist from the first game. But there's nothing more you really need to know to proceed, which I appreciated since I came into the story blind. Now, if I want to go back to play the first one, I've got something to go on as well. As Mina makes her way through the city, she explores a variety of locations such as the police station, a bizarre underground market, and plenty of other areas that hold the key to driving back the Vicious Sister and whatever she has planned. The gameplay loop consists of Mina exploring each area on a 2D plane, exploring rooms and passageways to find key items like keycards and maps or to deliver items to characters. Most of the time, you'll find yourself in one area on the map, and you'll need to get to another. But you won't have the item you need to get there, which means you'll need to go on a trek until you get it. This can eventually wear on the nerves because of the constant back-and-forth and backtracking, but each area is inventive enough to hold your attention. There are also usually side quests to help you out in some way, such as building an improvised taser. Whatever would you need a taser for? Well, you may have forgotten that this is a survival horror game. Where's the survival and horror come in? Right about the time you pick up the quest to make that taser. Until then, Mina is defenseless against any of the dangers in her way: falling bodies, poison clouds, ghosts that reach out to scratch you, and all that fun stuff. You can sprint around to avoid some of these things, but you need to watch your stamina and health points. Neither are unlimited, and letting them run out spells doom in some cases. But the real fun begins when Ms. Song and her cohorts start following you around. Ms. Song can appear just about anywhere on each map, or one of the baddies that follow her, and she can slash at you to quickly whittle your health down. Unfortunately, you can do little to bring it back up quickly if you really start getting in a tight spot – you get limited inventory space and it can be difficult to get to the item you need in time if it's not part of your current hot bar setup. This is where things get annoying. While you don't have much to defend yourself, Ms. Song is a walking disaster. She'll have you dead and forced to go back to a save point in the blink of an eye, which makes for some needlessly frustrating gameplay. For a good while, if you don't know your way around the map you're currently exploring, she'll just appear and slash you to death unless you can get away quickly enough to hide under a desk, in a locker, or somewhere else. You have a limited inventory, so you'll undoubtedly run out of health items before you can heal up from her repeated damage, and that makes it difficult to get past her as well. The key is hiding somewhere before she finds you (the music will swell so you know) and successfully completing a set of quick time events. Sometimes, if you hide while she can see you, those events (a few well-timed button presses) can't save you. It can get extremely frustrating until you work out a system, and admittedly I didn't find this part scary or engrossing  it was just a hindrance most of the time. A good amount of the horror n your Xbox One.",80,"As a 2D horror game, The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters manages to pull itself up in a genre filled by cliches, using its mysterious story and atmosphere to create a unique experience.",/game/the-coma-2-vicious-sisters/

I actually played it from start to finish in one sitting. I think it took around 3 to 4 hours to beat the first level of difficulty. There is three different levels of difficulty so this one is going to keep you busy a long time. That was playing it solo. you might be able to do it a little quicker with help. It has 2-4 player local coop. I imagine that would be a ton of fun I'll have to try it out next time I got friends over. As far as playing it solo it's challenging, but not to the point it's frustrating. I died a few times, but usually beat the level the next try. There are tons of levels. I didn't count them, but It's a really large map. It's loaded with levels. Each one spiking in difficulty as you go. Usually they introduce a new weapon, enemy, or ability as you go as well. There is tons of content and daily objectives that really add a lot of replay value to this one.

You play as Tesla, and use many of his great inventions to take out Lovecraft and his many monsters. You have pistols, shotguns, energy weapons, and so so much more even EPIC weapons. So many weapons and even a Mech. You start each level with the Mech until it runs down, then you have to collect pieces of it to reassemble it to use again. You can also upgrade it to where it lasts longer. That is one of your many upgrades available to you. You upgrade using crystals you find while playing. There is just so many things in this game to make it feel fresh and fun from start to finish. Like Perks you will find as you play. each time you level up on a level you will get two random perks to choose from. Perks like 30%  more health, 20% more weapon damage, bouncing bullets, and so much more. No way I could name them all. Like i said tons and tons of content.

Weapons, Perks, and upgrades aren't the only thing there is tons of. Monsters galore !!! You will come across so many variations of monsters. each with different attacks and abilities. Some will explode leaving fire on the ground, some will shoot things at you, some will just run you down and try and melee you. There are a few bosses as well. I believe 3 to 4 of them. The final confrontation with Lovecraft is also very action packed and unforgettable. I also really enjoyed the art style in the cut scenes. I was pulled into the really entertaining about some really legendary characters. Tesla and Lovecraft are timeless characters in history, and this game does a excellent job of introducing them to a new generation of gamers.",80,"10tons Ltd has managed to find extraordinary margins within the genre as restricted as top-down shooters.

Visually beautiful although there is not much variation.
Gun, ability, and perk selections are outstanding.  I do wish however that there was a way to lock in with a specific weapon once you acquire it.
REGARDING THE DIFFICULTY CURVE: The first of the 3 realms is a fair challenge.  Its nice to earn new weapons and new perks.  By the time you get to the 2nd realm, the difficulty really ramps up.  I would have like to have seen a smoother increase in difficulty over the 3 realms.  At the beginning of the 2nd realm, you will start to encounter levels that seem near impossible.
Collecting crystals to upgrade or unlock abilities is very time consuming, but if you love the game-play, then its worth it.

Each level will either task the player with mowing down waves of enemies thrown at them, or completing basic tasks such as collecting items or destroying other non-threatening objects. Each level can be completed between a few seconds and a few minutes, with an entire playthrough on a single difficulty lasting a few hours through its 20+ levels. That said, there’s a decent amount of content to be found in this title.

After completing a few tutorial levels and collecting all of the pieces needed to assemble your mech suit, you will begin each level in the suit, which is a limited ability that will drain quickly. Once it has been depleted you can collect the pieces again, as they will respawn at random points in the level and once complete, and you can activate the ability again at your leisure. In addition to the mech, you can teleport or dash through enemies and obstacles, which makes traversing the level and avoiding enemies quite easy on the standard difficulty. This ability can be used multiple times in succession and has a fairly quick recharge rate.

The arsenal at your disposal is pretty normal for this type of game. You’ll start each level with a basic pistol and typically find various types of shotguns, machine guns, but being that this is Tesla, you’ll also find a gun that shoots lightning balls. You are able to carry one crowd-control ability in addition to one weapon at a time. While the abilities are limited to a set number of uses, the weapons feature unlimited ammo, although they must be reloaded. The biggest game changer will be the perks that modify how your weapons fire, with upgrades such as ammo bouncing off of walls, piercing groups of enemies, or multiple bullets being fired at the same time being up for grabs. I found the repeater shotgun (basically a fully automatic version) with the multi-shot and bouncing effects to be the most worthwhile. When you end up with a good roll, it’s amazing.

During standard play you’ll level up Tesla and be given the option between one of two perks to apply to the character. The upgrades stack, so if you’re lucky enough to get multiples of the more devastating perks, you’ll want to take advantage of them. These come fairly often, but reset each time the player leaves the level, giving the title a rouge-lite feel. This works for the most part but can add frustration as well. Since the upgrades and weapons available are randomized, some of the more difficult levels will be harder if you don’t find something to even out the playing field, resulting in multiple attempts to complete the level.

There are also permanent upgrades that can be applied to your character. These require the player to collect crystals that are rewarded for killing X number of a certain enemy, finishing levels, completing weekly bounties, and will appear randomly in higher levels as pickups. These upgrades do not change gameplay as much as the perks do mid-game, but they will help the player once reaching the higher difficulties. The biggest issue with these is the cost of the upgrades compared to how often you accrue them not being balanced. Having completed the first difficulty and being half way through the second as of this writing, I have only been able to purchase a few of these.

Offering the high level of polish that 10tons LTD has been known for in its previous releases (Time Recoil, Jydge), the game controls like it should. The only thing I would have changed would have been removing the right trigger requirement to shoot and simply use the right stick. The enemies you face are well rendered and rarely blend into the level, which has been a bit of a setback in previous shmups. With the visuals being on par with most indie games you’ll find on the market, the graphics won’t disappoint, but are nothing to write home about. You’ll face off against spiders, blobs, and strange tentacles, among other ghastly stylized creatures that spew a respectable amount of purple blood upon death. While the bosses are simply larger versions of the normal enemies, they pose a decent challenge and require the player to strategically choose their upgrades early in these encounters.

If you would like to take a friend with you on your journey into madness, the game offers local co-op play. Sadly, I did not have a companion available to play with, so I cannot comment on how well this works. For those that are into endless modes, the game has you covered, with the option being unlocked early into the game. If you’re a fan of the shmup genre or 10tons Ltd’s other work, you won’t be disappointed.",80,"You may initially think that 10tons have gone mad by pitting the brains of Nikola Tesla against the weirdness of H.P. Lovecraft – and you’d be right. But whilst they are mad, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are wrong and once more they’ve managed to create another addictive little twin stick shooter.",/game/tesla-vs-lovecraft/
Tesla vs Lovecraft,"Tesla vs Lovecraft is an intense top-down twin stick arena shooter. Play as the enigmatic inventor Nikola Tesla harnessing the static energy to power up Tesla-Mech and give the lovecraftian nightmares a lesson in horror!

Tesla vs Lovecraft is a top-down twin stick shooter with goal based levels. The games highlight features are Quantum Teleportation, which allows the player to warp short distances even through solid objects, and the Tesla-Mech, which provides the player an immense boost to firepower for a limited time.

Genre hallmarks such as a large arsenal of weapons, a multitude of player empowering perks, monster crushing powerups, and secondary weapon abilities are also included.",10tons,Top-Down Shoot-'Em-Up,8,"The twin-stick shooting genre has been going for a long while now and over the years its spawned some classics which have made this particular genre my go to genre. Tesla vs Lovecraft is the latest twin-stick shooter to come to the fore and whilst it doesn’t offer anything different from what you’ve already seen before it still manages to provide you with more than enough enjoyable moments. The gameplay that’s on offer in the game is an incredible amount of fun and the best thing is that the shooting elements remain tight and responsive throughout your playthrough. Whilst I enjoyed the gameplay a lot it does however get a little too difficult at times and it will cause you to have a few frustrating moments every now and then, but they do however do a good job of combating this problem. They combat this problem by offering you a co-op option and not only does that make things easier it also makes things more fun and enjoyable at the same time. In terms of content the game has more than enough for you to be getting on with and with the added unlockables the game is likely to keep you satisfied for quite a while. Some of the unlockables and perks though are unfortunately a little lacklustre and don’t improve you much, but thankfully most of them have been designed really well and they certainly beef up your attack. Something that surprised me about Tesla vs Lovecraft was the amount of stages the game has. There are an abundance of stages for you to sink your teeth into and the best thing is that each stage has a lot of variety present in them so that without a doubt keeps things fresh and interesting for longer. The game also has the bonus of a decent story and I found that it interacted with the gameplay extremely well, which is great. The presentation side of the game disappointed me a little bit and I was just hoping for a little bit more. Don’t get me wrong there is nothing bad here its just there isn’t much that stands out which can make things become a little tedious at times. At the end of the day as far as twin-stick shooters go Tesla vs Lovecraft is a decent addition to the genre. Don’t get me wrong there are better games out there, but it doesn’t get too much wrong and the stuff it does get right is the most important of elements. If you’re after a game that provides you with a lot of fun whilst retaining a challenge at the same time then you can do much worse than Tesla vs Lovecraft, and for that reason it gets a nice thumbs up from me.",80,"Tesla vs Lovecraft is a great twin-stick shooter. I liked 10tons’ previous efforts, and I think this one is very satisfying to play. Its enemies, guns, perks and abilities are all varied and play well with each other, and the first time I stacked several 'one extra projectile fired per shot' perks and jumped in my mech, I couldn’t help but grin at the hail of bullets I was unleashing.",/game/tesla-vs-lovecraft/

Many of the elam are in denial, but some of them want to take the radical step of allowing banlits, including women, into the Guild.",Spellbind Studios,Roguelike,8,"Hi guys, let's discuss Rogue Wizards for a bit here shall we..

First of all, this game reminds me greatly of the 'Braveland Trilogy' and that being said you can already create a pretty good idea about, ''if you're actually going to like it or not'' because i know such games might be a bit too boring for some.. I'm a bit **** so i guess i couldn't go wrong with owning a copy of this nice looking and fun to play game.
But again, it's just like i said before, you'll either going to love or hate it but that doesn't make this a bad game if you don't like it.
And that's precisely why i'm letting you guys know, why i personally like this game a lot.

Let's talk about the graphics: The game looks pretty nice and cartooney (like Braveland and such) and the animations are nicely done although don't expect blitzes all over the screen or bright flashes because this game is by all means not a AAA graphical masterpiece! But all in all, it looks pretty nice, it doesn't glitch and it works well with everything else.. So what's not good about that, right?
Let's talk about the music/sound: The music for this game is pretty much kept simple although the tunes are catchy and the animation/effects etc all sound just as one would expect from such a game. It works pretty well together impo.
Now let's talk about the gameplay: The gameplay is set up in turnbased mode as soon as you encounter enemies or obstacles such as hidden traps etc. The grid/map is also devided in tiles, so each step you make will be on one of those tiles each turn. While in battle (outside battle those limitations are absent) you'll need to do some planning as to whether to move, change weapons, cast spells or heal yourself during the turn/time you're given. Everything is done in steps so make note of that when you're used to playing a dungeon crawler and you like to rush in like Rambo because this is not such a game.. You will be whimpy at first, but soon enough you'll be wearing nice armor, wielding massive weapons and using destructive spells (you can explore, craft/sell stuff) all at the same time which i personally think is a really nice way to let you as a player experiment freely. Also you'll earn a ton of experience along the many main and sub quests, so each time you earn a level up you can invest those points into 3 separate skills such as Power, Finesse, and Stamina. (and you'll unlock more buildings along the way too that upgrade/sell you all kinds of neat stuff..)

There are 3 primary character based skills, namely: 'Power, Finesse and Stamina'..
Power: Speaks for itself as it will allow the player to boost the strength of the character, including increasing the damage output for all his attacks.
Finesse: Is your basic dodge, shield, luck counter that will affect pretty much everything you do so don't ignore that skill!
Stamina: Works hand in hand with Power, because both make sure you can remain longer in tough battles while making it possible to dish out a world of hurt to those that seek to end you (it's a Roguelike right)..
However, you're always accompanied by 1 or two minions etc that can usually hold their own pretty well, unless cornered by bosses or packs of poisonous blobs etc.
After completing missions you will be rewarded by gaining additional magic points that you can freely spend in the magic skills department which is always helpful when you would or better said will be encountering tougher enemies and bosses. Note that each enemy has resistances and weaknesses so make sure to spend those points at the earliest sign you're encountering foes that are immune to your current skill/weapon sets etc.
Don't worry though, because you can freely adjust your character within any level so just keep your eyes open when you're facing an enemy because it will be made clearly visible as to what his/her strengths and weaknesses are.

I can say much more about this fun game, but it is probably best that i don't spoil you guys too much and so all that's really left for me to say is, get the game at a sales and play it just like i did and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as i do too.

Personal/Value Score 82/100",80,"While its story and approach play it safe, the smooth gameplay and optional “perma-death” Hard Mode still bring plenty to enjoy. With a wide variety of weapons and spells to choose from and a unique experience behind each randomly-generated door, it keeps things fresh without stepping too far outside of established comfort zones.",/game/rogue-wizards/

It certainly is better than Dragon Fin Soup ... but significantly worse than SotS the Pit.

pro:

- nice graphical style (although minimal animations)
- engaging concept of turn based simultanous moving/acting
- interesting item levelling system

con:

- visual grid is WAAY too small - limiting the view distance to something like dense fog
- sound and music are rather poor
- Monster balancing is rather bad in my opinion. Too many monsters have abilities that are unavoidable and/or able to stun-lock the player. Furthermore bosses dish out and take damage hundredfold (or so it seems) compared to normal mobs. I had a boss that would have an unavoidable ranged attack from the very fringe of my vision - that would one-hit-kill my fully healthy character. All other mobs up to that boss followed a steady but easily managable difficulty curve.
- The game only allows the player to craft the very important potions at randomly spawned cauldrons. At the same time it does not allow the player to own more than 5 potions at any given time. Health is not regenerating - and as said before - many attacks are unavoidable.
It comes down to very unfair situations where you ran out of health potions - with no means of healing up... no matter how careful you proceeded.

However - as it stands ... this would be a great game for tablet and/or mobile phone ... kind of. But for PC ... it is too simplistic, too flawed to be anything but average at best (and because there are not too many games around that do the same)

If you do like dungeon crawlers with permadeath, procedural generated environment, lots of equipment, crafting and simultanous semi turn based acting .... i suggest you get Sword of the Stars the Pit ... it is superior in every way.",70,"Rogue Wizards is a solid casual roguelike with unique monster designs, perpetually generated dungeons and 10-12 hours of story-mode gameplay. Dungeons themselves are challenging and fun, requiring a bit strategy to defeat monsters which utilize truly unique and interesting attacks.

A gave it a 9/10, but I had to lower my rate to 8/10 because of one thing: They should have given more love to the avatar and the items appearance. You have no visual customization options over your toon and all items of each type look the same. Also, body armour, boots and hats don't show on your character. This does not interfere with the mechanics but it's always nice to see your avatar change; it gives you the satisfaction of progress.

You only control two characters across the entire game and with battles being largely melee-oriented you're strategic options are limited. Given how annoying it can be to queue up attacks or target specific enemies when swarmed, this is probably one of those games that fares a bit worse on consoles and would benefit from the freedom offered by a mouse-and-keyboard. The inclusion of stealth gameplay is nice, but loses some of its luster when you realize enemies completely ignore dead bodies.

The story and world are fantastic. The dynamic between the two well-realized protagonists carries the feeling of a buddy movie and the way it flip-flops the role of orcs and humans turns fantasy conventions on their head. Not everything is entirely fleshed out though. For example, one seemingly important side-character isn't fleshed out and I believe a subplot involving one of the lead's father might have been left on the cutting room floor. However, the main thread itself is excellent and the fact that I was left wanting a bit more exploration into the supporting elements should serve as a testament how compelling the setting is.

With levels being so linear funnelling you from point A to point B with little room for side excursions and player choice largely being an illusion in the narrative, I can't help but wonder if Of Orcs and Men might not have been better served as a straight action game. Because with the approach taken here actually playing through it isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world.

Thankfully its interesting…
Of Orcs and Men is an action RPG game about the struggle between Orcs and men…
Its humans vs green skins…
Here you play as 2 characters…
Arkail who is a warrior brute from the legendary Bloodjaws as well as his Goblin companion Styx who offers ranged and stealth gameplay who’s job is to help Arkail get to where he needs to go on his mission to kill the emperor and change the course of the war…
The story and characters are the best part of the game…
I laughed out loud numerous times thanks to the loudmouth Styx having no filters when talking to Arkail and other characters.. And the story is full of twists and turns that this 12 hour game is genuinely enjoyable and surprising…
You even get to make choices to change minor story outcomes
and the level design here is great...
This is a very linear game... but areas feel open and theyre crawling with enemies and equipment…
Where the game is held back though is its combat itself…
Here you can play as either Styx or Arkail... and you can switch back and forth instantaneously…
Styx, who was my favorite to play as can go into stealth mode and clear some or all of the enemies out before progressing to prevent as few combat situations as possible which is ideal..
Because the combat is just no fun...
Basically both characters are on autopilot…
You put attacks in their commands list from different fighting stances and let them do their thing...
you really don’t even have to touch the controller until late in the game if you don’t want to…
because of this put in commands combat system, you never truly feel in control…
You don’t feel like you’re using strategy to win...
just that youre desperately running around with styx throwing knives and healing Arkail so you don’t have to start again... neither of the 2 have strategy programmed into them… if you leave styx he automatically goes into close range when he has considerably less health than arkail… so hell die almost instantly…
Its almost like you really have no choice but to use him
In some instances youll get into fights after messing up a stealth kill or being seen and arkail is just standing there looking at you instead of running to help…
As you do complete battles youll level up so you can balance the characters in areas theyre weak or make them stronger in areas there already strong in.. So the juggling act isn’t as annoying…
And you can unlock new skills and upgrade them with a choice of a perk to suit your gameplay style…
but it’s a bad sign when playing your game is the worst part of your game...
its an alright time and worth experiencing..
Especially for the story, level design, and being introduced to these characters…
It’s just rough to get through…

Rpg elements are very basic leveling is ok but there is an obvious lack of depth on the equipment end of this, armour and weapons are few and far between with little chance to actually upgrade. I did have fun playing this game but it is pretty standard.",70,"'Of Orcs and Men' is a flawed game, to be sure, but it also holds your attention and actually challenges you, unlike many hand holding releases of late.",/game/of-orcs-and-men/

~~This game was fun for me this OCTOBER 2013. And I ignored the fact that it was an old game and was wanting to spend some MONEY I HAD ON MY account. And this was worth it for a affordable game..
--Graphics aren't Last of us,Halo,Or Bioshock but does that matter on NON-blockbuster games anyways? NO! With arcade or PSN or downloadable games Graphics and voice acting need only be swervicable for our fun. Story & gameplay and unique level up or loot etc.. I enjoyed this game and if one is 100% true to themselves when they start playing it, then dissapointmen t will be less because I knew this game was just a 2 day type game. anything more is a perk..

--No game deserves a ZERO! We should only be allowed so many ZERO's, or it should be monitored or controlled..I bet 90% of reviewers who attack games with a ZERO do it on a regular ****!
- I could see a 2 maybe. a ONE **** is brokem and can not be **** a ZERO is misused..
--I look forward to innovation with scoring...

I gave this a 10 to balance out the OBVIOUS Hate-Spam that took place..
-Metacritic has a good Rep but that wont last forever.

before I get into it, let me states some facts: 90% of gamers are men, male gamers are more prone to enjoy violent games, the manlier the characters, the more the male gamers will enjoy it.

THAT BEING SAID.

This game is about as polished at a pile of poop. Instead of immersing you into a fantasy world where you play an orc, you come away feeling like you played a green painted, redneck with about as much nod to his own orchood, as me. They curse in English, which jars you. And, it's not even cursing to accentuate sentences. It's cursing, in the way that white frat boys curse, just to punctuate sentences. So instead of you thinking, wow these orcs are real manly tough guys, you come away thinking I WONDER DO THEY TAN IN BEDS OR OUT IN THE SUN. The voice acting doesn't help that they sound like fresh out the bed dweebs, raspy, breathy, man-voice with boy grammatical structure.

It would have been much better if the developer took the time to come up with 100 orc ""words"" and punctuate all the orc conversations with them.

Use everything at your disposal to avoid a demoness hellbent on killing you!,Devespresso Games,Survival,8,"The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters as in the best survival horror games have you leaping out of your seat, your pulse pounding, and sweat soaking your T-shirt. That's part of what makes the genre such an addictive one. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is a slick, exciting 2D take on your typical zombie-laden shooter, with high production values and a distinct Korean flavor that helps it stand out from the rest of the pack. Save for a few missteps, it shines brightly as a surprisingly competent indie horror game that's modest yet enjoyable. The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters is actually a sequel to a game called The Coma: Cutting Class, which I had never heard of before jumping into this review. Fortunately, this particular entry can be played and enjoyed on its own without any prior knowledge of the original. You play as a student at Sehwa High named Mina Park. One day after school, she passed out following a shady interaction with her teacher Ms. Song and a fellow student. When Mina wakes up, she finds herself trapped in a nightmarish version of her everyday world called The Coma. With little explanation, she's suddenly chased down by a maniacal, bloodthirsty version of Ms. Song, who runs her down at every opportunity to try and stab Mina to death. Ms. Song is being controlled by what you'll soon learn is called the ""Vicious Sister,"" an entity that apparently wants Mina (and everyone else for that matter) out of the way. Mina must first escape her school and find shelter across the city as she works out a way to fell this bizarre Vicious Sister and the rest of her minions before it's too late. The game does share connections to the first Coma story, but they're mainly tangential, in that Mina is a friend of Youngho, the protagonist from the first game. But there's nothing more you really need to know to proceed, which I appreciated since I came into the story blind. Now, if I want to go back to play the first one, I've got something to go on as well. As Mina makes her way through the city, she explores a variety of locations such as the police station, a bizarre underground market, and plenty of other areas that hold the key to driving back the Vicious Sister and whatever she has planned. The gameplay loop consists of Mina exploring each area on a 2D plane, exploring rooms and passageways to find key items like keycards and maps or to deliver items to characters. Most of the time, you'll find yourself in one area on the map, and you'll need to get to another. But you won't have the item you need to get there, which means you'll need to go on a trek until you get it. This can eventually wear on the nerves because of the constant back-and-forth and backtracking, but each area is inventive enough to hold your attention. There are also usually side quests to help you out in some way, such as building an improvised taser. Whatever would you need a taser for? Well, you may have forgotten that this is a survival horror game. Where's the survival and horror come in? Right about the time you pick up the quest to make that taser. Until then, Mina is defenseless against any of the dangers in her way: falling bodies, poison clouds, ghosts that reach out to scratch you, and all that fun stuff. You can sprint around to avoid some of these things, but you need to watch your stamina and health points. Neither are unlimited, and letting them run out spells doom in some cases. But the real fun begins when Ms. Song and her cohorts start following you around. Ms. Song can appear just about anywhere on each map, or one of the baddies that follow her, and she can slash at you to quickly whittle your health down. Unfortunately, you can do little to bring it back up quickly if you really start getting in a tight spot – you get limited inventory space and it can be difficult to get to the item you need in time if it's not part of your current hot bar setup. This is where things get annoying. While you don't have much to defend yourself, Ms. Song is a walking disaster. She'll have you dead and forced to go back to a save point in the blink of an eye, which makes for some needlessly frustrating gameplay. For a good while, if you don't know your way around the map you're currently exploring, she'll just appear and slash you to death unless you can get away quickly enough to hide under a desk, in a locker, or somewhere else. You have a limited inventory, so you'll undoubtedly run out of health items before you can heal up from her repeated damage, and that makes it difficult to get past her as well. The key is hiding somewhere before she finds you (the music will swell so you know) and successfully completing a set of quick time events. Sometimes, if you hide while she can see you, those events (a few well-timed button presses) can't save you. It can get extremely frustrating until you work out a system, and admittedly I didn't find this part scary or engrossing  it was just a hindrance most of the time. A good amount of the horror n your Xbox One.",80,"As a 2D horror game, The Coma 2: Vicious Sisters manages to pull itself up in a genre filled by cliches, using its mysterious story and atmosphere to create a unique experience.",/game/the-coma-2-vicious-sisters/

I actually played it from start to finish in one sitting. I think it took around 3 to 4 hours to beat the first level of difficulty. There is three different levels of difficulty so this one is going to keep you busy a long time. That was playing it solo. you might be able to do it a little quicker with help. It has 2-4 player local coop. I imagine that would be a ton of fun I'll have to try it out next time I got friends over. As far as playing it solo it's challenging, but not to the point it's frustrating. I died a few times, but usually beat the level the next try. There are tons of levels. I didn't count them, but It's a really large map. It's loaded with levels. Each one spiking in difficulty as you go. Usually they introduce a new weapon, enemy, or ability as you go as well. There is tons of content and daily objectives that really add a lot of replay value to this one.

You play as Tesla, and use many of his great inventions to take out Lovecraft and his many monsters. You have pistols, shotguns, energy weapons, and so so much more even EPIC weapons. So many weapons and even a Mech. You start each level with the Mech until it runs down, then you have to collect pieces of it to reassemble it to use again. You can also upgrade it to where it lasts longer. That is one of your many upgrades available to you. You upgrade using crystals you find while playing. There is just so many things in this game to make it feel fresh and fun from start to finish. Like Perks you will find as you play. each time you level up on a level you will get two random perks to choose from. Perks like 30%  more health, 20% more weapon damage, bouncing bullets, and so much more. No way I could name them all. Like i said tons and tons of content.

Weapons, Perks, and upgrades aren't the only thing there is tons of. Monsters galore !!! You will come across so many variations of monsters. each with different attacks and abilities. Some will explode leaving fire on the ground, some will shoot things at you, some will just run you down and try and melee you. There are a few bosses as well. I believe 3 to 4 of them. The final confrontation with Lovecraft is also very action packed and unforgettable. I also really enjoyed the art style in the cut scenes. I was pulled into the really entertaining about some really legendary characters. Tesla and Lovecraft are timeless characters in history, and this game does a excellent job of introducing them to a new generation of gamers.",80,"10tons Ltd has managed to find extraordinary margins within the genre as restricted as top-down shooters.

Visually beautiful although there is not much variation.

REGARDING THE DIFFICULTY CURVE: The first of the 3 realms is a fair challenge.  Its nice to earn new weapons and new perks.  By the time you get to the 2nd realm, the difficulty really ramps up.  I would have like to have seen a smoother increase in difficulty over the 3 realms.  At the beginning of the 2nd realm, you will start to encounter levels that seem near impossible.
Collecting crystals to upgrade or unlock abilities is very time consuming, but if you love the game-play, then its worth it.

Each level will either task the player with mowing down waves of enemies thrown at them, or completing basic tasks such as collecting items or destroying other non-threatening objects. Each level can be completed between a few seconds and a few minutes, with an entire playthrough on a single difficulty lasting a few hours through its 20+ levels. That said, there’s a decent amount of content to be found in this title.

After completing a few tutorial levels and collecting all of the pieces needed to assemble your mech suit, you will begin each level in the suit, which is a limited ability that will drain quickly. Once it has been depleted you can collect the pieces again, as they will respawn at random points in the level and once complete, and you can activate the ability again at your leisure. In addition to the mech, you can teleport or dash through enemies and obstacles, which makes traversing the level and avoiding enemies quite easy on the standard difficulty. This ability can be used multiple times in succession and has a fairly quick recharge rate.

The arsenal at your disposal is pretty normal for this type of game. You’ll start each level with a basic pistol and typically find various types of shotguns, machine guns, but being that this is Tesla, you’ll also find a gun that shoots lightning balls. You are able to carry one crowd-control ability in addition to one weapon at a time. While the abilities are limited to a set number of uses, the weapons feature unlimited ammo, although they must be reloaded. The biggest game changer will be the perks that modify how your weapons fire, with upgrades such as ammo bouncing off of walls, piercing groups of enemies, or multiple bullets being fired at the same time being up for grabs. I found the repeater shotgun (basically a fully automatic version) with the multi-shot and bouncing effects to be the most worthwhile. When you end up with a good roll, it’s amazing.

During standard play you’ll level up Tesla and be given the option between one of two perks to apply to the character. The upgrades stack, so if you’re lucky enough to get multiples of the more devastating perks, you’ll want to take advantage of them. These come fairly often, but reset each time the player leaves the level, giving the title a rouge-lite feel. This works for the most part but can add frustration as well. Since the upgrades and weapons available are randomized, some of the more difficult levels will be harder if you don’t find something to even out the playing field, resulting in multiple attempts to complete the level.

There are also permanent upgrades that can be applied to your character. These require the player to collect crystals that are rewarded for killing X number of a certain enemy, finishing levels, completing weekly bounties, and will appear randomly in higher levels as pickups. These upgrades do not change gameplay as much as the perks do mid-game, but they will help the player once reaching the higher difficulties. The biggest issue with these is the cost of the upgrades compared to how often you accrue them not being balanced. Having completed the first difficulty and being half way through the second as of this writing, I have only been able to purchase a few of these.

Offering the high level of polish that 10tons LTD has been known for in its previous releases (Time Recoil, Jydge), the game controls like it should. The only thing I would have changed would have been removing the right trigger requirement to shoot and simply use the right stick. The enemies you face are well rendered and rarely blend into the level, which has been a bit of a setback in previous shmups. With the visuals being on par with most indie games you’ll find on the market, the graphics won’t disappoint, but are nothing to write home about. You’ll face off against spiders, blobs, and strange tentacles, among other ghastly stylized creatures that spew a respectable amount of purple blood upon death. While the bosses are simply larger versions of the normal enemies, they pose a decent challenge and require the player to strategically choose their upgrades early in these encounters.

If you would like to take a friend with you on your journey into madness, the game offers local co-op play. Sadly, I did not have a companion available to play with, so I cannot comment on how well this works. For those that are into endless modes, the game has you covered, with the option being unlocked early into the game. If you’re a fan of the shmup genre or 10tons Ltd’s other work, you won’t be disappointed.",80,"You may initially think that 10tons have gone mad by pitting the brains of Nikola Tesla against the weirdness of H.P.

The gameplay that’s on offer in the game is an incredible amount of fun and the best thing is that the shooting elements remain tight and responsive throughout your playthrough. Whilst I enjoyed the gameplay a lot it does however get a little too difficult at times and it will cause you to have a few frustrating moments every now and then, but they do however do a good job of combating this problem. They combat this problem by offering you a co-op option and not only does that make things easier it also makes things more fun and enjoyable at the same time. In terms of content the game has more than enough for you to be getting on with and with the added unlockables the game is likely to keep you satisfied for quite a while. Some of the unlockables and perks though are unfortunately a little lacklustre and don’t improve you much, but thankfully most of them have been designed really well and they certainly beef up your attack. Something that surprised me about Tesla vs Lovecraft was the amount of stages the game has. There are an abundance of stages for you to sink your teeth into and the best thing is that each stage has a lot of variety present in them so that without a doubt keeps things fresh and interesting for longer. The game also has the bonus of a decent story and I found that it interacted with the gameplay extremely well, which is great. The presentation side of the game disappointed me a little bit and I was just hoping for a little bit more. Don’t get me wrong there is nothing bad here its just there isn’t much that stands out which can make things become a little tedious at times. At the end of the day as far as twin-stick shooters go Tesla vs Lovecraft is a decent addition to the genre. Don’t get me wrong there are better games out there, but it doesn’t get too much wrong and the stuff it does get right is the most important of elements. If you’re after a game that provides you with a lot of fun whilst retaining a challenge at the same time then you can do much worse than Tesla vs Lovecraft, and for that reason it gets a nice thumbs up from me.",80,"Tesla vs Lovecraft is a great twin-stick shooter. I liked 10tons’ previous efforts, and I think this one is very satisfying to play. Its enemies, guns, perks and abilities are all varied and play well with each other, and the first time I stacked several 'one extra projectile fired per shot' perks and jumped in my mech, I couldn’t help but grin at the hail of bullets I was unleashing.",/game/tesla-vs-lovecraft/

Many of the elam are in denial, but some of them want to take the radical step of allowing banlits, including women, into the Guild.",Spellbind Studios,Roguelike,8,"Hi guys, let's discuss Rogue Wizards for a bit here shall we..

First of all, this game reminds me greatly of the 'Braveland Trilogy' and that being said you can already create a pretty good idea about, ''if you're actually going to like it or not'' because i know such games might be a bit too boring for some.. I'm a bit **** so i guess i couldn't go wrong with owning a copy of this nice looking and fun to play game.
But again, it's just like i said before, you'll either going to love or hate it but that doesn't make this a bad game if you don't like it.
And that's precisely why i'm letting you guys know, why i personally like this game a lot.

Let's talk about the graphics: The game looks pretty nice and cartooney (like Braveland and such) and the animations are nicely done although don't expect blitzes all over the screen or bright flashes because this game is by all means not a AAA graphical masterpiece! But all in all, it looks pretty nice, it doesn't glitch and it works well with everything else.. So what's not good about that, right?
Let's talk about the music/sound: The music for this game is pretty much kept simple although the tunes are catchy and the animation/effects etc all sound just as one would expect from such a game. It works pretty well together impo.
Now let's talk about the gameplay: The gameplay is set up in turnbased mode as soon as you encounter enemies or obstacles such as hidden traps etc. The grid/map is also devided in tiles, so each step you make will be on one of those tiles each turn. While in battle (outside battle those limitations are absent) you'll need to do some planning as to whether to move, change weapons, cast spells or heal yourself during the turn/time you're given. Everything is done in steps so make note of that when you're used to playing a dungeon crawler and you like to rush in like Rambo because this is not such a game.. You will be whimpy at first, but soon enough you'll be wearing nice armor, wielding massive weapons and using destructive spells (you can explore, craft/sell stuff) all at the same time which i personally think is a really nice way to let you as a player experiment freely. Also you'll earn a ton of experience along the many main and sub quests, so each time you earn a level up you can invest those points into 3 separate skills such as Power, Finesse, and Stamina. (and you'll unlock more buildings along the way too that upgrade/sell you all kinds of neat stuff..)

There are 3 primary character based skills, namely: 'Power, Finesse and Stamina'..
Power: Speaks for itself as it will allow the player to boost the strength of the character, including increasing the damage output for all his attacks.
Finesse: Is your basic dodge, shield, luck counter that will affect pretty much everything you do so don't ignore that skill!
Stamina: Works hand in hand with Power, because both make sure you can remain longer in tough battles while making it possible to dish out a world of hurt to those that seek to end you (it's a Roguelike right)..
However, you're always accompanied by 1 or two minions etc that can usually hold their own pretty well, unless cornered by bosses or packs of poisonous blobs etc.
After completing missions you will be rewarded by gaining additional magic points that you can freely spend in the magic skills department which is always helpful when you would or better said will be encountering tougher enemies and bosses. Note that each enemy has resistances and weaknesses so make sure to spend those points at the earliest sign you're encountering foes that are immune to your current skill/weapon sets etc.
Don't worry though, because you can freely adjust your character within any level so just keep your eyes open when you're facing an enemy because it will be made clearly visible as to what his/her strengths and weaknesses are.

I can say much more about this fun game, but it is probably best that i don't spoil you guys too much and so all that's really left for me to say is, get the game at a sales and play it just like i did and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as i do too.

Personal/Value Score 82/100",80,"While its story and approach play it safe, the smooth gameplay and optional “perma-death” Hard Mode still bring plenty to enjoy. With a wide variety of weapons and spells to choose from and a unique experience behind each randomly-generated door, it keeps things fresh without stepping too far outside of established comfort zones.",/game/rogue-wizards/

Many of the elam are in denial, but some of them want to take the radical step of allowing banlits, including women, into the Guild.",Spellbind Studios,Roguelike,5,"This game is kind of similar to Dragon Fin Soup or Sword of the Stars the Pit. It certainly is better than Dragon Fin Soup ... but significantly worse than SotS the Pit.

pro:

- nice graphical style (although minimal animations)
- engaging concept of turn based simultanous moving/acting
- interesting item levelling system

con:

- visual grid is WAAY too small - limiting the view distance to something like dense fog
- sound and music are rather poor
- Monster balancing is rather bad in my opinion. Too many monsters have abilities that are unavoidable and/or able to stun-lock the player. Furthermore bosses dish out and take damage hundredfold (or so it seems) compared to normal mobs. I had a boss that would have an unavoidable ranged attack from the very fringe of my vision - that would one-hit-kill my fully healthy character. All other mobs up to that boss followed a steady but easily managable difficulty curve.
- The game only allows the player to craft the very important potions at randomly spawned cauldrons. At the same time it does not allow the player to own more than 5 potions at any given time. Health is not regenerating - and as said before - many attacks are unavoidable.
It comes down to very unfair situations where you ran out of health potions - with no means of healing up... no matter how careful you proceeded.

However - as it stands ... this would be a great game for tablet and/or mobile phone ... kind of. But for PC ... it is too simplistic, too flawed to be anything but average at best (and because there are not too many games around that do the same)

If you do like dungeon crawlers with permadeath, procedural generated environment, lots of equipment, crafting and simultanous semi turn based acting .... i suggest you get Sword of the Stars the Pit ... it is superior in every way.",70,"Rogue Wizards is a solid casual roguelike with unique monster designs, perpetually generated dungeons and 10-12 hours of story-mode gameplay. Dungeons themselves are challenging and fun, requiring a bit strategy to defeat monsters which utilize truly unique and interesting attacks. While the boss battles and AI are a little lackluster, the ability to teleport within floors, bonuses for defeating all enemies, and the replayability offered by the Gauntlet mode make Rogue Wizards a good investment for the small price tag of $15.",/game/rogue-wizards/

It has very nice and clever mechanics and it's quite addictive!

A gave it a 9/10, but I had to lower my rate to 8/10 because of one thing: They should have given more love to the avatar and the items appearance. You have no visual customization options over your toon and all items of each type look the same. Also, body armour, boots and hats don't show on your character. This does not interfere with the mechanics but it's always nice to see your avatar change; it gives you the satisfaction of progress. Also it's boring to look at the same exact model for so many hours when everything on you has supposedly changed!",70,"Rogue Wizards is inherently difficult, but for the most part, it’s a rewarding, challenging difficulty that keeps the player engaged.",/game/rogue-wizards/

While this sounds like a good idea it leads to far more missed taps than anything. Precise control is a necessity in lemmings and touch controls ruin it.
All this could be easily avoided by allowing you to pause at the correct time and enable an item on a particular lemming. I tried to do this to no avail.

Following a mutant invasion, Max sets out with his squirt gun and jetpack to bring those mudds to justice. But what keeps it from being an unoriginal platformer? First, Max has a jetpack that can let him glide for a limited time. Enemies are all invincible to anything but his squirt gun, you'll need to use strategy to avoid and shoot them. But what makes Mutant Mudds unique is its 'layer-hopping' idea. While Donkey Kong Country Returns included this before, Mutant Mudds has many different layers on top of each other, so it's not doing it for show as much as DK Country. This great idea is dragged to, and past, its full potential: you get clouds that blow you forwards to the layer in front, and enemies generally navigating between layers. It makes such good use of the 3D effect that Mutant Mudds is very frustrating without the 3D on, as you find yourself trying to avoid enemies that are on another layer, and making stupid mistakes due to confusion. This means that Mutant Mudds is at home on 3DS and wouldn't work on any other platform. The graphics are simple but charming, a lovely throwback to a by-gone era. The chiptune soundtrack is excellent. Generally, Mutant Mudds' presentation is truly great. The price is a bit too high for only 40 levels, but you're still getting several hours of enjoyment. But Pullblox was round about the same price and had a potential sixty hours in it. This is how a level editor would have really helped Mutant Mudds. It's not a complicated platformer, so a level editor would've been ideal. It would also make the price a lot more worthwhile. Still, this is one of the best platformers on eShop, and you must, without a doubt, download it.",85,"Mutant Mudds is a fitting homage to the 8-bit era of gaming.

After playing it for myself, I've come to find it's a very good game, but has a few issues that keep it from true greatness. GAMEPLAY: the gameplay was tight and very solid. With that said, it's jump and shoot gameplay was kind of a letdown after enjoying MSF's and VVVVVV's more unique approaches to the platforming genrÃ. DIFFICULTY: the game is rather difficult (which isn't a bad thing), and most of the time it's handled very well, but in the later levels I noticed that there were some enemies that would attack off screen, and there were also a few ""leaps of faith"". It was a little disappointing to see the dev resort to those kinds of cheap tricks to ensure difficulty in the later moments. LENGTH: the game is a tad overpriced, but you'll still get quite a bit from this game (especially if you play all the bonus levels). GRAPHICS: it has a very charming retro look, but it's not sure whether it wants to be an homage to the 8-bit or 16-bit era, instead it seems to be a mix of the two that doesn't fully envoke the kind of nostalgic feeling it would have, had it chosen one era more specifically. With that said, the 3D effect is utterly fantastic, and is used to great effect. SOUND: while not the best soundtrack in the world, it captures that retro vibe perfectly. STORY: befitting of the retro era, it takes a very minimalist approach to storytelling. The concept (kid fighting mud monsters with water gun) feels uninspired, and something a child might come up with. CONCLUSION: if you can get past the fact that the game is a little ""safe"" in design and concept (and the cheap difficulty tactics later on), you'll find a solidly built retro styled platformer that's fun to play.",84,Mutant Mudds is a challenging and amazing game for Nintendo 3DS.

The biggest reason for this is its very short gameplay. The game forces you to replay every level over 2-3 times to truly beat it. This is its biggest flaw; I really feel this game could have been much better with more content. When I first saw the level screen, with all the doors leading off to the various levels, I assumed this was only world 1. But no, that was the entire game's worth of levels. Still, the game has some solid controls, and the graphics are great. I don't think the art style of the game is overly fantastic (it kind of reminds me of the style of Drawn to Life on the original DS), but it gets the job done. It lies somewhere between a retro throwback and a modern platformer. And to the people whining about the difficulty, it's that difficult because it's a retro throwback game, and most older games are very difficult (go play Castlevania 3, then come back and tell me this game is hard.) All-in-all, I think this is a solid, well designed game that fell short of its potential.",80,"Charming, Mutant Mudds does not change the genre, but certainly pleases those who are already fans.",/game/mutant-mudds/

In case you can't tell, that is a very biased score. Some of the complaints include ""you end up replaying a level dozens of times until you perfect the move required to pass the point that you are stuck at"", and while this a bit true, it REALLY gets easier once you start getting it down. So it's not really a developer's mistake, just a skill factor. It takes awhile to get better and better at parts in each level, but really that adds to the game. And if it were super easy, the game would be over in a few seconds.
Moving on: There's really nothing amazingly fantastic that makes you jaw-drop. But theres really not much to complain about. The jet-pack controls may not be perfect, in my opinion, but its really only a matter of practice. Mutant Mudds is a solid game that took me 10 hours to completely beat. And a special unlockable at the very end gives me reason to replay with a new file. The game looks really nice, and again it is DEFINITELY a nicely-challenging and solid platformer.

I have been following Mutant Mudds since it was first announced in Nintendo Power.

GAMEPLAY:
The gameplay is flawless. The platforming challenge is perfect. The difficulty curve is just right. Some people may whine about it being too difficult, but like anything challenging the reward is great.

ART:
The art is an incredible blend of 8-bit and 16-bit. I think they called it 12-bit. :-) The 3D effect when you go into the background is really fantastic.

SOUND:
The music is authentic NES style music, which might sound bad, but it sounds really amazing.

REPLAY:
I found this game really addicting. Even now that I have completed it 100% I find myself going back for more. It is just fun to navigate the levels, jumping, hovering, and shooting the Muddies.

BOTTOM LINE:
Buy it. I joined Metacritic just so I could leave a review for this fantastic game. Bravo Renegade Kid. I look forward to your other eShop games.

The gameplay is fun but I cannot get past the overall design mechanics. This is one of those games that presents you with a near impossible task, usually having to do with timing, and then starts you at the beginning of the level when you die. Consequently, you end up replaying a level dozens of times until you perfect the move required to pass the point that you are stuck at. That mechanic draws bad memories and I get frustrated very quickly due to my experiences with other games with this same problem.
